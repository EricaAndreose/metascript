                        into the hotel and he was following the bell-boy with his luggage, to the
                        elevator. He ... he glanced at me as he walked past, just a glance. Nothing
                        more. But I could hardly move. That afternoon Helena went to the movies with
                        her friend and you and I made love, and we made plans about our future and
                        we talked about Helena and yet at no time was he ever out of my mind. And I
                        thought if he wanted me, even if it was for only one night, I was ready to
                        give up everything. You, Helena, my whole fucking future. Everything. And
                        yet it was weird because at the same time you were dearer to me than ever
                        and ... and at that moment my love for you was both tender and sad. I ... I
                        barely slept that night and I woke up the next morning in a panic. I didn't
                        know whether I was afraid he had left or that he might still be there, but
                        by dinner I realized he was gone and I was relieved.</p>

                    ante-room. A STEWARD, also masked, elegantly gestures him through heavy velvet
                    drapes into a vast hall its walls, ceilings, balconies and columns all finely
                    carved in white marble. The hall is crowded with people dressed similarly to
                    BILL: black hooded cloaks and fullfaced Venetian Carnival-style masks of every
                    conceivable design and colour. BILL sees a brightly lit circle of kneeling
                    figures. In the centre is a figure wearing a red cloak who is conducting a
                    strange ritual (this is RED CLOAK). He is waving an incense burner in one hand
                    while holding a staff in the other.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">At the far end of the hall BILL sees NICK heavily blindfolded
                    and dressed in a white tuxedo. NICK is sitting at an array of keyboards
                    producing eerie music that resonates through the hall and up to the marble
                    balconies and galleries where gather cloaked and masked spectators.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">RED CLOAK now walks slowly around the circle of figures and
                    then moves to the centre. He bows deeply and the kneeling figures prostrate
                    themselves before him. From a column furthest away from the spectacle BILL
                    watches as RED CLOAK bangs his staff on the red carpet, a command that returns
                    the figures to their kneeling positions. Then he moves slowly around the circle
                    swinging the incense burner before moving back to the centre and banging the
                    staff again which causes the figures to rise to their feet.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">RED CLOAK bangs the staff on the carpet a further time: the
                    figures unclasp the hooks of their cloaks and let them fall off their shoulders
                    to the floor. The figures are now revealed to be beautiful young women, naked
                    except for their masks and G-strings.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">As RED CLOAK turns on the spot one of the women leans to her
                    right to lightly embrace the woman next to her. She places a kiss on her lips.
                    The kissed woman now leans to her right and repeats the act 'With the next
                    woman, the kiss now being ''passed" around the circle.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">While BILL tries to fathom what is happening two figures on a
                    balcony opposite seem to be taking a more than passing interest in him. They
                    continue staring at BILL until he slowly becomes aware of them. One of the
                    figures wears a tricom mask while the other hides behind an androgynous mask.
                    There is a sinister air to both of them. The man in the tricom mask bows to
                    BILL, seemingly in recognition. BILL, uncertain at first, returns the bow. Then
                    his attention is drawn back to the women in the circle.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">RED CLOAK, with a rap of his staff on the floor, commands a
                    woman to her feet. The woman bows to RED CLOAK who then bestows a "blessing"
                    upon her. She then leaves the circle and approaches a man in the surrounding
                    crowd. She leans forward to "kiss" the man, their masked lips touching, before
                    leading him off out of the hall.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">BILL watches as the procedure is repeated with the "blessed"
                    women apparently choosing men at random from the spectators.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">RED CLOAK has now reached a woman in the circle who wears a
                    mask more alluring than the others, a beautiful design with black feathered
                    plumes arising above her head (this is MYSTERIOUS WOMAN). After receiving the
                    "blessing" the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN turns and walks straight to BILL.</stage>
                <stage type="setting">She gently places her hand on his shoulder as she leans
                    forward to "kiss" him. Then she leads BILL by the hand out of the hall.</stage>

                        tried to pass me an envelope but they saw it and and took it away and said
                        that any mail or messages for him would be collected by someone properly
