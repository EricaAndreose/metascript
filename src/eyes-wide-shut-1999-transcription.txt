BILL and ALICE's apartment block on Central Park West.

3. INT. DRESSING ROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A handsome man in evening dress is looking for something. He walks into a bedroom, goes to a small table,
picks up keys and a mobile phone and walks to a chest
of drawers. This is Bill Harford, a doctor.

Bill opens a drawer and takes out a handkerchief

BILL
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

ALICE (o/s)
Ah ... isn't it on the bedside table?

BILL walks across to the bedside table and finds his
wallet.

BILL
Ah, yep ... now listen, you know we're running
a little late?

BILL goes around the bed and into the en-suite bathroom. ALICE is sitting on the loo wearing an evening
dress.

ALICE
I know. How do I look?

BILL goes to the mirror to check his appearance without
looking at ALICE.

BILL
Perfect.

ALICE gets up from the loo as BILL checks his bow tie.

ALICE
Is my hair OK?

BILL
It's great.

ALICE drops the toilet tissue in the loo and flushes it

away.
ALICE
You're not even looking at it.
BILL turns and looks at her adoringly.

BILL
It's beautiful.

BILL kisses her affectionately on the cheek and leaves
the bathroom.

BILL
You always look beautiful.

ALICE
Did you give Roz the phone and pager numbers?

BILL (o/s)
Yeah. I put it on the fridge ... let's go, huh?

ALICE washes her hands and dries them as she looks in
the mirror.

ALICE
Good. All right, I'm ready.

ALICE removes her glasses, leaves the bathroom and
goes to the bed to pick up her coat and bag. BILL, his
overcoat on his arm, switches off the music centre. They
leave the bedroom together. BILL switches off the lights.

4. INT. CORRIDOR - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL and ALICE walk down the corridor. ALICE starts
to put her coat on and BILL helps her.

BILL
What's the name of the baby sitter?

ALICE
(whispering)
Roz.

They enter a spacious and comfortably furnished living
room where HELENA, their seven-year-old daughter,
sits watching television with ROZ, the student baby sitter. There is a decorated Christmas tree behind the sofa.

ALICE
OK, Roz. We're going now.

ROZ
(standing)
Wow! You look amazing, Mrs Harford!

ALICE
Oh, thank you ... Helena, are you ready for
bed?

BILL puts on his overcoat.

HELENA
Yes, mummy. Can I stay up and watch The
Nutcracker?

ALICE
What time's it on?

HELENA
Nine o'clock.

ALICE
Sure, you can watch that.

HELENA
Can I stay up until you get home?

ALICE
No, darling.

BILL
(kissing Helena)
It's going to be a little late for that.

ALICE
(to Roz)
Now, the phone number is on the fridge . . ..

ALICE bends down to kiss HELENA.

ROZ
OK.

ALICE
And there's plenty of food in there, so help
yourself.

ROZ
OK.

ALICE
We shouldn't be home any later than one
o'clock.

BILL
I'll hold our cab tonight to take you home.

ROZ
Thanks, Dr Harford.

ALICE
(to Helena)
You be a good baby.

HELENA
Good night, mummy. Good night, daddy.
Goodbye . . . bye.

ROZ
Have fun.

BILL and ALICE leave, blowing kisses and waving bye-bye to HELENA.

ALICE
(to Helena)
See you in the morning.

BILL and ALICE walk down the apartment corridor.

5. EXT. ZIEGLER MANSION - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A palatial house in mid-town Manhattan. Doormen
stand outside the entrance. A large stretch limo is
parked nearby.

6. INT. CORRIDOR - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

BILL and ALICE, holding hands, walk down a corridor
lined with display cases and works of art. A large party
is in progress. Guests, all in evening wear, are still arriving. An orchestra playing dance music can be heard further off in the house.

BILL and ALICE come into a large hallway where
their hosts, Victor ZIEGLER and his wife, ILONA, are
greeting the guests to their annual Christmas party.

BILL
Victor, Ilona....

ZIEGLER (o/s)
Bill, Alice....

The hall is large and marbled with a vast staircase in the
background. Illuminations creating a "curtain of light"
hang from the walls and there is a Christmas tree laden
with decorations. ZIEGLER, afit, sun-tanned man in his
fifties, and his beautiful wife welcome BILL and ALICE.

BILL
Merry Christmas!

ZIEGLER
Merry Christmas! How good to see both of you.
Thanks so much for coming.

ALICE
We wouldn't have missed it for the world.

ZIEGLER
Alice, look at you! God, you're absolutely
stunning.

ALICE
Oh, thank you.

ZIEGLER
(to Ilona)
And I don't say that to all the women, do I?

ILONA
Oh, yes, he does.

ALICE
He does!

ZIEGLER
(to Bill)
Hey, that osteopath you sent me to got to work
on my arm ... you should see my serve now,
it's terrific!

BILL
He's the top man in New York.

ZIEGLER
I could have told you that looking at his bill.
Listen, go inside, have a drink, enjoy the party
and I'll see you in a little bit. OK? Thanks for
coming.

BILL
Thank you.

ALICE
Bye.

BILL and ALICE make their way to the crowded main
reception room.

7. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

The walls are draped with the "curtain of light" illuminations seen in the corridor. There is a stage and upon
it is the small orchestra playi,ng ballroom music. The
guests dance on the crowded floor. BILL and ALICE
dance together.

ALICE
Do you know anyone here?

BILL
Not a soul.

ALICE
Why do you think Ziegler invites us to these
things every year?

BILL
This is what you get for making house calls.
On the stage there is a young man of similar age to BILL
playing the piano. He is dressed in a white tux and bow
tie. He looks around. This is NICK Nightingale. BILL notices him.

BILL
(to Alice)
You see that guy at the piano? I went to medical
school with him.

ALICE
Really? He plays pretty good for a doctor.

BILL
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

The bandleader brings the music to a stop.

BANDLEADER
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're enjoying
yourselves. The band is going to take a short
break now and we'll be back in ten minutes.

The guests applaud as the band leaves the stage.

BILL
(indicating Nick)
Let's go over and say hello to him.

ALICE
Honey, I desperately need to go to the
bathroom. You go and say hello and I'll meet
you ... where? At the bar?

BILL
Good.

BILL kisses ALICE on the cheek as she leaves the ballroom.

8. INT. ANTE-ROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

Crowded with guests. ALICE walks by a waiter holding
a tray with glasses of champagne. She takes a glass
without stopping and drinks it "in one" as she moves
away.

9. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

On stage, by the piano, Nick Nightingale sorts through
some sheet music as the band takes its break. Bill walks
up to the stage.

BILL
Nightingale! Nick Nightingale!

NICK looks around to see who is calling his name. He
jumps down from the stage and he and BILL greet each
other like old fri,ends.

NICK
Oh, my God! Bill! Bill Harford! How the hell are
you,buddy?

BILL
How long has it been?

NICK
Oh, jeez! I don't know, about ten years?

BILL
And a couple. Do you have time for a drink?

NICK
Sure.

BILL puts his arm round NICK's shoulders as they walk
to the other end of the ballroom.

BILL
God, you haven't changed a bitl

NICK
Thanks, I think. So how you doing?

BILL
Not too bad, you know, not too bad. I see you've
become a pianist.

NICK
Oh, yes. Well my friends call me that. How
about you? You still in the doctor business?

BILL
You know what they say, once a doctor always
a doctor.

BILL takes a couple of glasses of champagne from a
waiter standing with a tray and hands one to NICK.

NICK
Yes, or in my case, never a doctor, never a
doctor.

BILL
I never did understand why you walked away.

NICK
No? It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot. Cheers.

They "clink" glasses as a man in evening dress walks
up to NICK. This is ZIEGLER's SECRETARY.

SECRETARY
Excuse me ... Nick, I need you a minute.

NICK
Be right with you.
(to Bill)
Listen, I gotta go do something. If I don't catch
you later, I'm gonna be down the Village for
two weeks in a place called the Sonata cafe.
Stop by if you get a chance.

BILL
I'll be there. Great seeing you.

NICK
Good seeing you too.

They exchange friendly pats as Nick goes.

10. INT. ANTE-ROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION NIGHT

ALICE stands, back to the bar, holding a glass of champagne. The room is crowded with people talking. A tall,
handsome man, suave and middle-aged, also stands
at the bar. He turns from a conversation he is having
and notices ALICE next to him. His name is Sandor
SZAVOST. He takes a sip of whisky as he studies her, and
puts his glass down on the bar. ALICE, still looking for
BILL to join her, also puts her champagne glass down.
SZAVOST then nonchalantly picks ALICE's glass up as
ALICE turns to do the same.

ALICE
Umm, I ... I think that's my glass.

SZAVOST
I'm absolutely certain of it.

SZAVOST stares into ALICE's eyes as he seductively
drinks the contents ofALICE's glass.

SZAVOST
My name is Sandor Szavost. I'm Hungarian.

He takes Alice's hand and kisses it.

ALICE
(a little tipsy)
My name is Alice Harford. I'm American.

SZAVOST
Delighted to meet you, Alice. Did you ever read
the Latin poet Ovid on The Art of Love?

ALICE
Didn't he wind up all by himself? Crying his
eyes out in some place with a very bad climate?

SZAVOST
But he also had a good time first, a very good
time. Are you here with anyone tonight, Alice?

ALICE
With my husband.

SZAVOST
Oh, how sad! But then I'm sure he's the sort of
man who wouldn't mind if we danced.

ALICE thinks for a moment then offers her arm to
SZAVOST.

11. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

SZAVOST and ALICE dance closely on the crowded floor.

SZAVOST
What do you do, Alice?

ALICE
Well, at the moment I am looking for a job. I
used to manage an art gallery in Soho but it
went broke.
(giggles)

SZAVOST
Oh, what a shame! I have some friends in the
art game. Perhaps they can be of some help?

ALICE
Oh, thank you.

As they turn, ALICE catches sight of BILL talking to two
beautiful girls in the ante-room beyond.

SZAVOST
Someone you know?

ALICE
My husband.

SZAVOST
Oh. Don't you think one of the charms of
marriage is that it makes deception a necessity
for both parties?
ALICE laughs.

SZAVOST
May I ask why a beautiful women who could
have any man in this room wants to be
married?

ALICE
Why wouldn't she?

SZAVOST
Is it as bad as that?

ALICE
As good as that.

12. INT. ANTE-ROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION NIGHT

The two beautiful girls, GAYLE and NUALA, have their
arms draped around each other as they talk to BILL.

GAYLE
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

BILL
No, no. And it's very, very lovely to meet you
both.

They all laugh.

BILL
How do you spell Nuala?

NUALA
N ... U ... A ... L ... A.

GAYLE
You don't remember me, do you?

BILL tries to think.

GAYLE
You were very kind to me once.

BILL
Only once? That sounds like a terrible
oversight!

GAYLE
I was doing a photo session in Rockefeller
Plaza, on a very windy day.

BILL
And you got something in your eye?

GAYLE
Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

BILL
Right.

GAYLE
You were such a gentleman, you gave me your
handkerchief, which was also clean.

BILL
Well that is the kind of hero I can be ...
sometimes.

13. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

ALICE and SZAVOST continue dancing.

SZAVOST
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

ALICE
Why don't you tell me?

SZAVOST
It was the only way they could lose their
virginity and be free to do what they wanted
with other men ... the ones they really wanted.
ALICE

Fascinating.

14 . INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

GAYLE and NUALA walk on each side of BILL, their
arms linked through his.

GAYLE
Do you know what's so nice about doct or-.,

BILL
Usually a lot less than people imagi ne.

GAYLE
They always seem so knowledgeable.

BILL
Oh, they are very knowledgeable about all sort of things.

GAYLE
But I bet they work too hard. Just think of all
they miss.

BILL
You're probably right. Now. where exactly are
we going . . . exactly?

They come into a large room where there are few people.

GAYLE
Where the rainbow ends?

BILL
Where the rainbow ends?
They come to a stop.

NUALA
Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?

BILL
Well, now that depends where that is.

GAYLE
Well, let's find out.

A tall good looking man walks up to them and interrupts. He is HARRIS, ZIEGLER's personal assistant.

HARRIS
Excuse me, ladies.
(to Bill)
Sorry, Dr Halford. Sorry to interrupt. I wonder
whether you could come with me for a
moment? Something for Mr Ziegler.

BILL
Oh ... umm ... Fine.
(to the two girls)
To be continued?

HARRIS leads BILL across the hall and up the marble
staircase.

15. INT. BATHROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

ZIEGLER hurriedly pulls his trousers up while looking
down on a girl lying unconscious and naked in an armchair. This is MANDY who is making quiet muttering
noises. ZIEGLER is panic stricken. He hears a knock on
the door and runs barefoot across the bathroom to open
it.

ZIEGLER
Yeah?

He opens the door to see BILL standing there with
HARRIS. He shakes BILL's hand.

ZIEGLER
Bill, thank God.

ZIEGLER closes the door, leaving HARRIS outside to
keep watch.

ZIEGLER
We had a ... had a little accident here.
They walk over to MANDY.

BILL
What happened?

BILL takes a closer look at MANDY.

ZIEGLER
Well, she ... she was shooting up and she ...
she had a bad reaction.

BILL
(feels Mandy's pulse)
What did she take?

ZIEGLER
Speedhall or snowball or whatever the hell they
call it. You know, it's ... it's heroin and coke.

BILL
Heroin and coke ... uh-huh. Anything else?

ZIEGLER
Ah, yeah, a couple of drinks. Nothing really.
Some champagne. That was it.

BILL
How long's she been like this?

ZIEGLER
Maybe five minutes, six minutes. Something
like that.

BILL
What's her name?

ZIEGLER
Mandy ... Mandy.

MANDY continues making quiet, muttering noises.

BILL
Mandy. Mandy. Can you hear me, Mandy? Can
you hear me? Just move your head for me if you
can hear me. Just move your head for me if you
can hear me, Mandy. There you go, you can
hear me. Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy? Can you do that? Let me see you do
that. Let me see you open your eyes. There you
go. Come on, come on. Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me. Look at me. Look at me,
Mandy. Good. Good.

16. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

SZAVOST and ALICE are still dancing. ALICE is quite intoxi,cated by both SZAVOSTand the champagne.

SZAVOST
I love Victor's art collection, don't you?

ALICE
Yes ... it's wonderful.

SZAVOST
Have you ever seen his sculpture gallery?

ALICE
No, I haven't.

SZAVOST
He has a wonderful collection of Renaissance
bronzes. Do you like the period?

ALICE
Hmm ... I do.

SZAVOST
I adore it. The sculpture gallery is upstairs.
Would you like to see it? I can show it to you.
We won't be gone long.

ALICE
Maybe ... not just ... now.

17. INT. BATHROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

ZIEGLER, now dressed in his shirt, does his cufflinks up.

BILL leans up against a sideboard, anns folded, watching At.ANDY. She is still in the chair, but she is now covered with a blue bathrobe. ZIEGLER stands over her.

ZIEGLER
Well, that was really one hell of a scare you
gave us, kiddo.

MANDY
Sorry.

BILL
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

MANDY
Better.

BILL goes over to her and kneels down.

BILL
You are a very, very lucky girl. You know that?

MANDY
I know.

BILL
You're going to be OK this time, but you can't
keep doing this. You understand?

MANDY
Yeah.

BILL
You're going to need some rehab. You know
that, don't you?

MANDY
I know.

BILL
OK ... OK.

BILL gets up and turns to ZIEGLER.

BILL
Well, Victor, I think I can leave the rest to you.

ZIEGLER
Is it OK if I get some clothes on her and get her
out of here?

BILL
No. I'd ... I'd keep her here for another hour.

ZIEGLER
Another hour?

BILL
I'd have someone take her home.

ZIEGLER
OK ... OK.

They walk towards the door.

BILL
Goodnight, Mandy.

ZIEGLER
Listen, I can't thank you enough for this. You
saved my ass.

BILL
I'm glad I was here.

ZIEGLER
Bill ... I probably ... I know I don't have to
mention this, but this is just between us. OK?

BILL
Of course.

18. INT. BALLROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

ALICE, eyes shut, dances closely to SZAVOST, as if in a
trance. She brings herself "to" as they stop dancing.
ALICE

I think I've had a little too much champagne. I
think I have to go and find my husband now.

SZAVOST
I'm sure he'll be all right on his own a little
longer.

ALICE
Yes, but will I?

SZAVOST
Of course you will.

ALICE
No, no, no, I ... I really have to go. I have to go.

SZAVOST
You don't, you know.

ALICE
Yes, I do.

SZAVOST
Alice, I must see you again.

ALICE
That's impossible.

SZAVOST
Why?

ALICE
Because ... I'm married.

ALICE waves her ring finger in front of SZAVOST's face.
She kisses her index finger and plants it on SZAVOST's
lips as she leaves him on the dance floor.

19. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE stands naked in front of the bedroom mirror. She
removes an ear-ring as she sways around. As she begins
to take the other ear-ring off BILL comes up behind her
and starts to caress her. He puts his arms around her
and lovingly touches her. She responds to his caresses
by taking her glasses off and putting her arms around
him. They kiss. ALICE looks at herself in the mirror as
BILL kisses her neck and shoulder.

20. INT. RECEPTION - BILL'S SURGERY - DAY

The lift doors open and BILL steps out.

BILL
Good morning, Lisa.

LISA
Good morning, doctor. Your mail.

BILL walks through the reception towards his office.
BILL

Thank you. Good morning, Sarah.

SARAH
Good morning, doctor.

21. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

OK. That's fine. You can put your gown on.

23. INT. HELENA'S BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

HELENA, in a red dress and jumper, is havi,ng her hair
brushed by ALICE, still in her morning gown.

HELENA takes the brush as ALICE arranges her daughter's hair in a pony tail.

24. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - BILL'S SURGERY - DAY

BILL examines a young boy's neck glands as his mother
waits in the background.

BILL
Looking forward to Christmas?

ALICE is naked. She puts on a bra.

26. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - BILL'S SURGERY - DAY

Yeah.

ALICE, in skirt and bra, rolls deodorant under her arms
as HELENA cleans her teeth.

28. INT. LIVING ROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

29. INT. HELENA'S BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL and ALICE sit with HELENA as she reads from her
picture book, ALICE prompting her as BILL watches and
listens.

HELENA
Before me, when I jump into my bed.

30. INT. LIVING ROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE walks by the dining table as she goes to the sitting
room. She yawns as she goes.

ALICE
I should call the Zieglers and thank them for the
party last night.

BILL
I've taken care of that.

BILL sits on the sofa watching a football game on television. ALICE joins him.

ALICE
So how do you feel about wrapping the rest of
the presents?

BILL
(hesitates)
Oh, oh ... let's do that tomorrow.

31. INT. BATHROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE, tired, looks into the mirror of the bathroom cabinet. She opens it up and takes out a Band-Aid tin. She
opens the tin and removes a packet of cigarette papers
and a polythene bag ofgrass (marijuana). She leaves the
bathroom.

32. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE rolls a joint.

33. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE, lying on the bed in her underwear, takes a "pull"
on the joint. She passes the spliff to BILL, who sits on the
bed next to her dressed only in boxer shorts.

ALICE
Hmm ... tell me something ... those two girls
at the party last night. Did you, by any chance,
happen to fuck them?

BILL
(coughs and splutters)
What!? What are you talking about!?

ALICE
I'm talking about the two girls that you were so
blatantly hitting on.

BILL
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

ALICE
Hmm ... Who were they?

BILL
They were just a couple of models.

ALICE sits up next to BILL.

ALICE
And where did you disappear to with them for
so long?

BILL starts to kiss and touch ALICE.

BILL
Ohhhh! Wait a minute, wait a minute! I didn't
disappear with anybody. Ziegler wasn't feeling
too well. I got called upstairs to see him.
Anyway, who's the guy you were dancing with?

ALICE
(laughs)
A friend of the Zieglers'.

BILL
What did he want?

ALICE
(as Bill kisses her ear)
What did he want? Oh ... what did he want?
Sex - upstairs, then and there.

BILL
Is that all?

ALICE
Yeah ... yeah. That was all.

BILL
(kissing Alice)
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

ALICE
(giggles)
Yeah, that's right.

BILL
I guess that's understandable.

ALICE
(suddenly serious)
Understandable?

BILL
Because you are a very, very beautiful woman.

ALICE
Woah! Woah! Woah! Wait!

ALICE puts the spliff into the ashtray on the bed, disengages herself from BILL's arms, and gets up. She backs
up towards the bathroom leaving BILL sitting on the
bed.

ALICE
So ... because I'm a beautiful woman the only
reason any man wants to talk to me is because
he wants to fuck me! Is that what you're
saying?

BILL
Well, I don't think it's quite that black and
white, but I think we both know what men are
like.

ALICE now leans against the door frame.

ALICE
So, on that basis I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models?

BILL
There are exceptions.

ALICE
What makes you an exception?

BILL
What makes me an exception is that . .. I
happen to be in love with you and because
we're married and because I would never lie to
you or hurt you.

ALICE starts walking to the other end of the room.

ALICE
Do you realize that what you're saying is that
the only reason you wouldn't fuck those two
models is out of consideration for me, not
because you really wouldn't want to?

BILL
Let's just relax, Alice. This pot is making you
aggressive.

ALICE
No, it's not the pot, it's you! Why can't you ever
give me a straight fucking answer!

BILL
I was under the impression that's what I was
doing. I don't even know what we're arguing
about here.

ALICE
(sits on a stool)
I'm not arguing. I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

BILL
Where I'm coming from?

ALICE gets up and stands at the end of the bed.
ALICE

Let's say, let's say for example, you have some
gorgeous woman standing in your office naked
and you're feeling her fucking tits. Now, what I
wanna know ... I wanna know what are you
really thinking about when you're squeezing
them?

BILL
Alice, I happen to be a doctor. It's all very
impersonal and you know there is always a
nurse present.

ALICE
So, when you are feeling tits it's nothing more
than your professionalism, is that what you're
saying?

BILL
Exactly ... sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

ALICE
Now, when she is having her little titties
squeezed, do you think she ever has any little
fantasies about what handsome Doctor Bill's
dickie might be like?

BILL
Come on, I can assure you that sex is the last
thing on this fucking hypothetical woman
patient's mind.

ALICE
And what makes you so sure?

BILL
If for no better reason ... because she's afraid
of what I might find.

ALICE
OK! OK! So, so, so after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

BILL
What then? Ah, I don't know that, Alice. What
then? Look, women don't ... they basically
don't think like that.

ALICE gets up and provocatively points a finger at BILL
as she starts to pace up and down at the foot of the bed.

ALICE
Millions of years of evolution, right? Right?
Men have to stick it in every place they can, but
for women ... women it is just about security
and commitment and whatever the fuck ...
else!

BILL
A little oversimplified, Alice, but yes, something
like that.

ALICE
If you men only knew....

BILL
I'll tell you what I do know is that you got a
little stoned tonight. You've been trying to pick
a fight with me and now you're trying to make
me jealous.

ALICE
But you're not the jealous type, are you?

BILL
No, I'm not.

ALICE
You've never been jealous about me, have you?

BILL
No, I haven't.

ALICE
And why haven't you ever been jealous about
me?

BILL
Well, I don't know, Alice. Maybe because you're
my wife, maybe because you're the mother of
my child and I know you would never be
unfaithful to me.

ALICE
You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?

BILL
No, I'm sure of you.

ALICE bursts out laughing.

BILL
Do you think that's funny?

ALICE collapses onto the floor, her laughing fit uncontrollable now.

BILL
Fucking laughing fit, right?

ALICE calms down a little.

ALICE
Do you ... do you remember last summer at
Cape Cod?

BILL
Yes.

ALICE
Do you remember one night in the dining room?
There was this young naval officer and he was
sitting near our table with two other officers?

ALICE sits back against the radiator and focuses on her
story.

BILL
No.

ALICE
The waiter brought him a message at which
point he left. Nothing rings a bell?

BILL
No.

ALICE
Well, I first saw him that morning in the lobby.
He was ... he was checking into the hotel and
he was following the bell-boy with his luggage,
to the elevator. He ... he glanced at me as he
walked past, just a glance. Nothing more. But I
could hardly move. That afternoon Helena
went to the movies with her friend and you and
I made love, and we made plans about our
future and we talked about Helena and yet at
no time was he ever out of my mind. And I
thought if he wanted me, even if it was for only
one night, I was ready to give up everything.
You, Helena, my whole fucking future.
Everything. And yet it was weird because at the
same time you were dearer to me than ever and
... and at that moment my love for you was
both tender and sad. I ... I barely slept that
night and I woke up the next morning in a
panic. I didn't know whether I was afraid he
had left or that he might still be there, but by
dinner I realized he was gone and I was
relieved.

BILL is stunned by what ALICE is telling him and it is
some time before he can respond to the repeated ringing
of the telephone. He finally picks it up.

BILL
Hello? Yes, this is Dr Harford. When did it
happen? No, no, erh ... I have the address.
Thank you.
(to Alice)
Lou Nathansonjust died. I'm gonna have to go
over there and show my face.

34. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

BILL sits in the cab thinking about what ALICE has told
him.

35. INT. ROOM - CAPE COD - DAY

BILL, in his jealousy, fantasises about ALICE and the
NAVAL OFFICER making love.

36. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

BILL continues to torture himself with ALICE's confession.

37. INT. LOBBY - NATHANSON APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The elevator door opens and BILL comes out. He walks
across the elegant, art deco lobby and presses a doorbell.

38. INT. HALLWAY - NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

A maid walks to the door of the luxurious apartment
and peeps through the spy-hole. This is ROSA. She opens
the door.

BILL
Good evening, Rosa.

ROSA
Good evening, Dr Harford.

BILL
How is Miss Nathanson?

ROSA
Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

BILL
Thank you.

BILL walks down the hallway, passing numerous objets
d'art and paintings and comes to a door. He knocks.

MARION (o/s)
Come in.

BILL goes into the room.

39. INT. BEDROOM - NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL comes into the bedroom and is greeted by a beautiful woman in her late thirties. This is MARION Nathanson who is crying over the loss of her father.

BILL
Marion.

MARION
Oh! Dr Harford! How . . . how good of you to
come.

BILL
I came as soon as I got the message.

MARION
Oh, thank you.

BILL
I'm so ... I'm so sorry.

MARION
Oh, thank you.

BILL
Your father was a ... was a very brave man.

MARION
Oh, thank you.

BILL
How are you holding up?

MARION
Ah ... ah ... I'm a bit numb. I don't think it's
really sunk in yet. Erh, would you like to sit
down?

BILL walks around the bed and up to the dead body of
LOU NATHANSON. BILL puts his hand on the corpse's
forehead and then he and MARION move to a table and
chairs nearby and sit down.

MARION
It's so unreal. Daddy had such a good day. His
mind was clear and he remembered so many
things and then he had a little dinner and he
said he felt like taking a nap. I ... I went into
the kitchen and talked to Rosa for half an hour
at most and when I went back in to see how he
was I just thought he was asleep and then I ...
then I realized he wasn't breathing.

BILL
Marion, from what you've said, I'm sure your
father died peacefully in his sleep.

MARION
Oh, God! I hope so! I think I've been more afraid
of the way it was actually going to happen than
his death itself.

BILL
Have you had a chance to phone any of your
relatives?

MARION
I umm ... I tried to call my step-mother in
London but, erh, she was out. My boyfriend,
Carl, is making some calls and umm, he'll be
coming over soon. I think you've met Carl here
a few times?

BILL
Yes, I remember him. He's a teacher isn't he?

MARION
A maths professor. We're going to get married
in May.

BILL
Well, that's wonderful news. Congratulations.

MARION
Thank you. Carl has a new teaching
appointment at the University of Michigan.
We'll be moving out there soon.

BILL
Well, Michigan is a beautiful state. I think
you'll like it a lot.

MARION
(starting to break)
Yeah.

BILL
It really could be a wonderful change for you,
Marion.

MARION
I ... oh! No. I ... Oh, my God! No! I ... I love
you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

MARION tries to control herself, but she finally breaks
down. She looks at BILL in desperation then moves forward to kiss him passionately on his lips.

BILL
Marion.

MARION
I love you. I don't want to go away with Carl.

BILL
Marion, I don't think you realize ....

MARION
I do, even if I'm never to see you again, I want
at least to live near you.

BILL
Marion, listen to me, listen to me. You're very
upset right now and I don't think you realize
what you're saying.

MARION
I love you.

BILL
We barely know each other. I don't think we've
had a single conversation about anything
except your father.

MARION
I love you.
The sound of the door chimes is heard.

MARION
Oh, that's probably Carl. Please don't despise
me.

She gets up, leaving BILL to sit and ponder what has
happened.

40. INT. HALLWAY - NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT
ROSA opens the door to a studious-looking man in
glasses. This is CARL, MARION's fiance. He hands ROSA
his coat and scarf.

CARL
Hello, Rosa.

ROSA
Hello, Mr Thomas.

CARL
Is she ... is she in the bedroom?

ROSA
Yes, she is.

CARL
Thank you.

CARL walks down the corridor and comes to the bedroom door. He knocks.

MARION (o/s)
Come in.

41. INT. BEDROOM - NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

CARL enters and walks across to MARION. They kiss.

CARL
Darling, I'm so very sorry. Are you all right?

MARION
I'm OK.

CARL walks over to BILL and they shake hands.

CARL
Dr Harford, good evening.

BILL
Good evening, Carl.

CARL
Thank you very much for coming over here
tonight.

BILL
It's the least I could do.

CARL
It means a lot to us.

BILL
Thank you.
(pause)
Well, I, I was actually on my way out.
(to Marion)
Marion, your father was very proud of you and
I know you gave him great comfort these last
months.

MARION
Thank you.

CARL
Thank you.

BILL
Well....

CARL
Well ... I'll show you out.

BILL
Good night.

CARL shows BILL out and MARION is left in a state of
confusion.

42. EXT. STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

Cabs, night life, a few pedestrians.

43. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

BILL walks aimlessly along the street. He sees a young
couple up against a shop front kissing passionately,
oblivious of all around them.

44. INT. ROOM - CAPE COD - DAY

The taunting fantasy image ofALICE and the NAVAL OFFICER making love returns to haunt BILL.

45. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

BILL continues walking, beating his fists in anger over
his fantasy. He turns a comer and sees a gang of rowdy
college boys coming towards him. The six of them take
up the whole sidewalk.

STUDENT I
I'm serious, I got scars on the back of my neck.

They notice BILL and start to hurl insults at him.

STUDENT 2
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What team's this we're
trying to play for?

STUDENT I
Looks like the pink team!

BILL moves aside to avoid them, but as they pass, one of
them deliberately elbows him up against a car parked
by the sidewalk. BILL falls but regains his balance. The
students start to insult him, provocatively taunting him
about his sexuality. BILL stands and angrily stares at
them then, as they continue down the street shouting
their insults, he finally turns and walks on.

46. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

BILL continues on his way, hands deep in pockets, mind
deep in thought. He comes to a street crossing where he
has to wait before continuing. He is approached by a
young girl, dressed in a fun-fur coat and hat. This is
DOMINO.

DOMINO
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?

BILL
Ten past twelve.

DOMINO
Going anywhere special?

BILL
(a little annoyed)
No, I'm just ... just taking a walk.

He starts to cross the street and the girl falls in step
alongside him.

DOMINO
How'd you like to have a little fun?

BILL
I'm . . . I'm sorry?

DOMINO
A little fun? I just live right down there.

She indicates a house farther down the street.

DOMINO
Would you like to come inside with me?

BILL
Come inside with you?

DOMINO
Yeah. It's a lot nicer in there than it is out here.
They slow to a stop and BILL furtively looks around.

BILL
You ... you live in there?

He sees the apartment building, its front door painted
bright red.

DOMINO
Yes.

BILL
By yourself?

DOMINO
No. I have a room-mate but she's not home.
Hey, it's OK. Listen, no-one will bother us. It's
OK. Come on. Come on....

DOMINO gently pulls him up the stoop to the front door.

47. INT. LOBBY - DOMINO APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

DOMINO leads BILL across the small, dingy lobby to a
door on the ground floor. She unlocks the door and they
enter.

48. INT. DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

DOMINO comes in and BILL follows, looking around as
he does. He notices a decorated Christmas tree in the
hallway.

DOMINO
This is it.

BILL
A nice tree.

DOMINO laughs and leads him into a very messy
kitchen.

DOMINO
Oh, sorry about the mess. Maid's day off.

BILL looks around then sits awkwardly on the edge of
the bath tub.

BILL
It's a ... it's a ... cosy, cosy place.

DOMINO
It's OK.

There is an embarrassed silence as DOMINO takes off
her hat and coat.

BILL
So, do you, do you suppose we should talk about
money?

DOMINO
Yeah, I guess so. It depends on what you want
to do. What do you wanna do?

BILL
Well, what do you recommend?

DOMINO
What do I recommend? Umm ... well ... I ...
I'd rather not put it into words. How about you
just leave it up to me?

BILL
I'm in your hands.

DOMINO
OK ... and how does a hundred and fifty sound?

BILL
Sounds ... wonderful.

DOMINO
Don't worry, I don't keep track of the time.

49. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE sits eating cookies and smoking a cigarette while
watching television. She is dressed in her blue silk dress.
zng gown.

50. INT. BEDROOM - DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

DOMINO and BILL sit on the bed, faces close together.
Very slowly DOMINO leans forward and gently kisses
BILL on the lips. BILL, uncertain at first, responds a
little.

DOMINO
So, shall we?

BILL's mobile phone rings. Hesitating for a moment, he
finally gets off the bed and walks across to the stereo
music centre and switches it off. He turns to DOMINO
and puts his finger to his lips so DOMINO will keep quiet.

BILL
(to Domino)
Excuse me ...

BILL faces the wall away from DOMINO as he takes the
call.

BILL
Hello?

51. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE is on the telephone.

ALICE
Hi....

52. INT. BEDROOM - DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL
Hi. Is everything all right?

53. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE

Yeah ... I was, I was just wondering if you were
going to be much longer?

54. INT. BEDROOM - DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL
Umm .. . listen, it's .. . it's a little difficult to
talk right now. It could be a while.

55. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE
Any idea how long?

56. INT. BEDROOM - DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL
No, I don't really know. We're still waiting for
some relatives to arrive.

57. INT. KITCHEN - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ALICE
Well, I'm ... I'm gonna go to bed now.

58. INT. BEDROOM - DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL
OK. Bye-bye.

ALICE (o/s)
Bye.

DOMINO is now leaning back on the bed.

DOMINO
Was that Mrs Dr Bill?

BILL, embarrassed, walks back towards the bed.

BILL
Yes ... yes.

He sits down next to DOMINO again.

DOMINO
Do you have to go?

BILL
I have to go. I think I do.

DOMINO
Are you sure?

BILL
Yes, I'm afraid so. Ah, but listen, I want to pay
you anyway.

BILL takes his wallet out of his inside jacket pocket.

BILL
How much did you say it was? Hundred and
fifty?

DOMINO
Yeah, but you know what? You don't have to
bother about that.

BILL
No, it's all right.

DOMINO
No, really, you don't have to.

BILL
No, I want to.

DOMINO
Really?

BILL
Really.

BILL takes DOMINO's hand and presses the bills in it.

DOMINO
Well, thank you very much.

59. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

BILL walks down a street and happens by the Cafe Sonata where NICK Nightingale mentioned he was playing. BILL stops and looks in the window where he sees
a photograph of NICK sitting at the piano. BILL thinks
for a moment then makes for the door, which is opened
by a doorman.

BILL
Thank you.

60. INT. CAFE SONATA - NIGHT

BILL walks down the stairs of the club. We hear live
music as BILL is greeted by the MAITRE D'.

MAITRE D'
Good evening, sir. Would you like a table or
would you like to sit at the bar?

BILL
I'd like a table.

MAITRE D'
Please, follow me. Can I take your coat?

As BILL is taken to his table we see his fri,end, NICK,

playing piano on stage with a jazz trio.

BILL
(to Maitre D')
Thank you.

MAITRE D'
Can I get you anything to drink?

BILL
I'd like a beer.

MAITRE D'
Certainly.

BILL watches the group as it finishes its final number.
Then NICK quickly gets the band into the fast closing
theme to cover his introductions to the musicians and
his thanks to the audience.

NICK
Hope you enjoyed the music tonight. We're
going to be here for the next two weeks. So,
please, do stop by. I'm Nick Nightingale. Good
night.

NICK leaves the stage and walks through the club.

VOICE FROM AUDIENCE
Nick, that was great!

NICK
Oh, thanks.

BILL
Nightingale!

NICK sees BILL and goes over to him.

NICK
Hey, Bill! You made it.

BILL
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry. I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

NICK
That's all right, the band sucked tonight
anyway.

The MAITRE D' brings BILL his beer.

BILL
(to Nick)
What are you drinking?

NICK
A vodka and tonic, please.

BILL
Thank you.

NICK
So what brings you out at this hour?

BILL
I have a patient in the neighbourhood.

NICK
Do you live in the Village?

BILL
No, we have an apartment on Central Park
West.

NICK
Are you married?

BILL
Nine years.

NICK
Do you have any kids?

BILL
Yes, we have a seven-year-old daughter. How
about you?

NICK
I've got a wife and four boys in Seattle.

BILL
You're a long way from home.

NICK
Yeah, well, you've gotta go where the work is.

The MAITRE D' brings NICK his drink.

NICK
Thank you.

They touch glasses then drink.

BILL
So, is this your band?

NICK
No, this is just a pick-up band.

BILL
Who do you normally play with?

NICK
Anybody, anywhere. As a matter of fact I got
another gig later tonight.

BILL
You're playing somewhere else tonight?
NICK

Mmm.... they only get started there around
two.

BILL
In the Village?

NICK
Believe it or not, I don't actually know the
address yet.

BILL
You don't?

NICK
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's in a
clifferent place every time and I only get it an
hour or so before.

BILL
Different place every time?

NICK
So far.

BILL
What's the big mystery?

NICK dangles his hands in front of BILL'sface.

NICK
Hey, man! I just play the piano.

They start to giggle nervously.

BILL
Nick, I'm sorry. Is there something I'm missing
here?

NICK
I play blindfolded.

BILL
What?

NICK
Yeah, I play blindfolded.

BILL
You're putting me on?

NICK
No, it's the truth. And the last time, the
blindfold wasn't on so well ... man ... Bill, I
have seen one or two things in my life but
never, never anything like this ... and never
such women.

BILL
Well?

NICK's mobile phone rings. He takes it out of his pocket.

NICK
(to Bill)
Excuse me.
(speaking into phone)
Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This is Nick. Uh-huh, I
know where that is.

NICK takes a pen from his pocket and starts to write on
a paper napkin. He finds it difficult so BILL reaches
across and holds the napkin. NICK writes on it the word
"FIDELIO"

NICK
Uh-huh .. .. right. OK. Well, I'm on my way
right now. OK, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.

BILL
What is this?

NICK
It's the name of a Beethoven opera, isn't it?

BILL
Nick....

NICK
It's the password.

BILL
The password?

NICK
Yeah, like I'm ... I'm really sorry to do this to
you, Bill. I mean, I ... I gotta get going. I gotta
... I gotta go.

BILL
Nick, you know there is no way on earth that
you are going to leave here tonight without
taking me with you.

NICK
Come on, buddy, give me a break.

BILL
Nick, I'll tell you what. I've already got the
password. Just give me the address and I'll go
there by myself and there won't be any
connection between us whatsoever.

NICK
Listen, let's just say for one second that I was
prepared to do that. You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

BILL
Why not?

NICK
Because everyone is always costumed and
masked, and where the hell are you gonna get a
costume at this hour of the morning?

61. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

A taxi turns the comer and pulls up outside a costume
shop named RAINBOW FASHIONS. BILL gets out of the
cab and pays the driver.

BILL
Thanks. Keep the change.

BILL walks up the stoop and rings the bell. A voice responds through the intercom with a heavy Slavic accent.
This is MILICH.

MILICH (o/s)
Yes? Who is it?

BILL
Peter, this is Bill Harford. I apologize for
disturbing you at this late hour but I need your
help.

MILICH (o/s)
Who is it that you want?

BILL
Oh! I . .. I'm very sorry, I'm looking for Peter
Grenning, the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

MILICH (o/s)
What's your name?

BILL
My name is Bill Harford. I'm Mr Grenning's
doctor.

MILICH (o/s)
You are Grenning's doctor?

BILL
Yes.

MILICH (o/s)
OK. Just a moment.

BILL looks through the plate glass and sees a door open
inside. From it a man appears and walks towards BILL.

The man is middle-aged, has a beard and long hair and
wears a dressing gown. This is MILICH.

62. INT. HALLWAY - RAINBOW FASHIONS - NIGHT

MILICHJ talks to BILL who stands on the steps outside
the locked door.

MILICH
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

BILL
Yes, I am.

MILICH
He moved to Chicago - over a year ago.

BILL
He moved to Chicago? Oh, I wasn't aware of
that. Are you the present owner of Rainbow
Fashions?

MILICH
Yes, I am.

BILL
Well, first of all, please let me apologize once
again for disturbing you at this hour, Mr
umm? ...

MILICH
Milich.

BILL
Mr Milich. Just to let you know that I really am
Dr Harford, this is my New York State Medical
Board Card.
(holds wallet to glass)

MILICH
OK, so you are Dr Harford and if I see Peter I
tell him you were looking for him.

BILL
Oh, no, no! Wait, please, please. Listen, the
reason that I came here tonight was u.mm ...
basically the reason is, is that I need a costume.
And I'd be happy to pay you a hundred dollars
over the rental price for the inconvenience.

MILICH
A hundred dollars?

BILL
Yes.

MILICH
I don't think so.

BILL
Well, erh, OK. How about two hundred dollars?

MILICH
Two hundred dollars over the rental price?

BILL
Yes.

MILICH
OK.

63. INT. MAIN AREA - RAINBOW FASHIONS - NIGHT

MILICH opens the door, lets BILL in, then closes it behind them.

MILICH
Come in.

MILICH disables the burglar alarm system.

MILICH
Can't be too careful these days, hmm.
(indicates)
Please.

MILICH leads BILL through the shop to a counter. He
switches on a lamp.

MILICH
Is it any special costume you are looking for?

BILL
Yes, umm ... I need a tux, a cloak with a hood,
and a mask.

MILICH
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

BILL
Yes.

MILICH
OK. I think we find something for you. Follow
me, please.

MILICH leads BILL into another room of the shop.

64. INT. INNER ROOM - RAINBOW FASHIONS - NIGHT

MILICH
(pointing to mannequins)
Looks like alive, huh?

BILL
Yes, it's wonderful.

MILICH
Come. So, what colour cloak?

BILL
Umm . ...

MILICH
Black,brown,red?

BILL
Black.

MILICH
Are you sure the good doctor wouldn't like
something more colourful?

BILL
I don't think so.

MILICH
Clowns? Officers? Pirates?

BILL
No, just the tux, the black cloak ....

MILICH
With a hood and the mask.

BILL
Yes.

MILICH
OK. May I take your coat?

BILL
Yes.

BILL takes his coat and gives it to MILICH.

MILICH
You are medicine doctor, yes?

BILL
Yes, I am.

MILICH
Oh, look, doctor. I have some problem with my
hair, you know?

BILL
Your hair?

MILICH
It's starting to fall down, too fast. I lost in two
weeks a lot of hair, mostly here. Look at this,
here.

MILICH bends over to show his balding patch. BILL
quickly examines it.

BILL
Oh, yes.

MILICH
You see?

BILL
Yes.

MILICH
And?

BILL
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

MILICH
What, you can't help me?

BILL
No, you should see a trichologist -it's a hair
specialist ... Mr Milich. I've obviously left
things a bit late tonight, so if you don't
mind....

MILICH
OK, OK. I'm in hurry too, doctor. To get back to
bed.

BILL
I understand.

MILICH casts BILL's overcoat aside and goes to a rail of
hooded cloaks.

MILICH
So, black cloak?

Suddenly, MILICH stops and turns to BILL.

MILICH
Did you hear something? What is it?

MILICH walks towards a room behind a glass wall at
the back of the shop. He peers through the glass into the
darkness to try to see where the noise came from.

MILICH
What is it?

MILICH goes into the room through a door and switches
on a light. He looks down to a low table laden with the
remains of take-away meals. MILICH picks up a girl's
slip and suddenly hears a sound behind him. He pulls
aside a robe hanging on the wall to reveal a JAPANESE
MAN in underpants and fright wig who sneezes. MILICH angrily grabs the wig and explodes in anger.

MILICH
What is this? What on earth is going on here?

JAPANESE MAN 1
(very frightened)
Oh, Milich! I can explain everything.
MILICH notices something behind the sofa. He attacks it
with the wig in his hand and up jumps a young girl
dressed only in a bra and panties. This is MILICH's
DAUGHTER.

MILICH
(to Daughter)
You! What are you doing here? I'll kill you! I
promise I'll kill you!

Another JAPANESE MAN in a wig and covering his
"modesty" with a cloth pops up from behind the sofa.
MILICH grabs his wig and attacks him with it.

MILICH
And you, have you no sense of decency!?
Gentlemen, have you no sense of decency!?

The DAUGHTER grabs a shawl to cover herself.

JAPANESE MAN 1
Milich, are you crazy? We were invited here by
the young lady.

MILICH
Young lady? This is my daughter! Couldn't you
see she's a child? You will have to explain to police.

JAPANESE MAN 1
To the police?

MILICH makes for his DAUGHTER but she's off around
the sofa. MILICH tries to catch her but she evades him.
She runs into the shop and stands behind BILL who cannot understand what's going on.

MILICH
(to Daughter)
You little whore! I'll kill you for this! I promise,
I'll kill you! ... I'll kill you!
(to Bill)
Hold on to that girl for me, please.

BILL looks at the DAUGHTER as she smiles up at him.

JAPANESE MAN 1 (o/s)
Milich, this is preposterous. The young lady
invited us here.

MILICH angrily throws some clothing at the two cowering JAPANESE MEN.

MILICH
Couldn't you see? She's ... deranged!
(then to Bill)
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
(to Japanese)
Gentlemen, this is now police matter. You will
please stay here until I return.

MILICH leaves the room and locks the door behind him,
trapping the men inside.

JAPANESE MAN 1
Milich, what are you doing? Let us out of here.

MILICH
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
(to Bill)
Doctor, sorry, what colour did you say?

BILL
Umm....
I

MILICH
Black?

BILL
Black.

MILICH
(to Japanese men)
Gentlemen, please . .. have the goodness to be
quiet for the moment. Couldn't you see I try to
serve my customer?
(to Bill)
Sorry.
(to Daughter)
And you, little whore, go to bed at once, you
depraved creature! I'll deal with you as soon as
I serve this gentlemen.

DAUGHTER
(whispers into Bill's ear)
You should have a cloak lined with ermine.

The DAUGHTER slowly leaves the room, giving BILL a
suggestive look as she goes. BILL looks at her perplexed.

65. EXT. TAXI CAB - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

A taxi speeds over the bridge.

66. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

BILL sits in the cab alone with his churning thoughts.

67. INT. ROOM - CAPE COD - DAY

BILL's relentless fantasy returns as he imagines the
NAVAL OFFICER and his wife making love.

68. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

BILL closes his eyes as if to shut out the thought of his
wife with another man.

69. INT. TAXI CAB - POV BILL - NIGHT

BILL's view from the cab as it swings off the bridge and
onto a link road which will take it through the suburbs
and out to the country.

70. EXT. TAXI CAB - SUBURBAN ROAD - NIGHT

The taxi drives through the suburbs. Festive illuminations strung across the road proclaim "HAPPY HOLIDAY."

71. EXT. TAXI CAB - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

The cab proceeds down a tree-lined country road.

72. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

BILL looks out to see where he is.

73. INT. TAXI CAB - POV BILL - NIGHT

BILL's POV: the entry gates of a large country house can
be seen through the trees to the right. Two men in dark
coats are waiting in front of them. A sign shows the
name of the house as "Somerton." The two men watch
the cab closely.

74. EXT. ENTRY GATES - NIGHT

The taxi slows to a halt.

75. INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

The TAXI DRIVER switches on his light and BILL opens
his wallet.

CAB DRIVER
OK. That's seventy-four fifty.

BILL
Seventy-four fifty, all right. There's eighty. I
promised you fifty bucks over the meter, right?
I'll make that a hundred ... if you wait for me.

BILL holds up a $100 bill and tears it in half.

BILL
So, let the meter run. I'll give you the other half,
plus the meter, when I get back. OK?

CAB DRIVER
How long you gonna be?

BILL
I dunno, maybe an hour or more, but maybe
only ten minutes. I'll leave my stuff here in the
back. OK?

CAB DRIVER
OK.

The TAXI DRIVER takes one half of the $100 note and
BILL gets out of the cab.

76. EXT. ENTRY GATES - NIGHT

BILL closes the cab door and slowly walks towards the
two GATEMEN.

GATEMAN 1
Good evening, sir.

BILL
Good evening.

GATEMAN 1
Can we be of any help?

BILL
Well, I suppose you'd like the password?

GATEMAN 1
If you like, sir.

BILL
Fidelio.

GATEMAN 1
Thank you, sir. We'll run you up to the house.
The GATEMAN gestures to a vehicle on the other side of
the gates.

77. EXT. "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

A vast country house set amidst its own grounds. Limousines of all descriptions are lined up each side of the
driveway. The vehicle ferrying BILL drives up and stops.
BILL steps out and then walks up to the front door which
is opened for him. BILL enters the house.

78. INT. PILLARED HALLWAY - "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

BILL walks in and is approached by a MASKED BUTLER. The sound of strange music can be heard in the
background.

MASKED BUTLER
Good evening, sir.

BILL
Good evening.

MASKED BUTLER
Password, sir.

BILL
Fidelio.

BUTLER
Thank you, sir.

The MASKED BUTLER takes BILL's coat. Underneath
BILL is wearing a hooded cloak. BILL then puts his mask
on and pulls the hood over his head as he walks towards
another door which is opened for him by a MASKED
MAN. BILL enters.

79. INT. ANTE-ROOM/MARBLE HALL "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

BILL comes in through the door and walks slowly across
the ante-room. A STEWARD, also masked, elegantly gestures him through heavy velvet drapes into a vast hall its walls, ceilings, balconies and columns all finely
carved in white marble. The hall is crowded with people
dressed similarly to BILL: black hooded cloaks and fullfaced Venetian Carnival-style masks of every conceivable design and colour.
BILL sees a brightly lit circle of kneeling figures. In the
centre is a figure wearing a red cloak who is conducting
a strange ritual (this is RED CLOAK). He is waving an
incense burner in one hand while holding a staff in the
other.

At the far end of the hall BILL sees NICK heavily blindfolded and dressed in a white tuxedo. NICK is sitting at
an array of keyboards producing eerie music that resonates through the hall and up to the marble balconies
and galleries where gather cloaked and masked spectators.

RED CLOAK now walks slowly around the circle of
figures and then moves to the centre. He bows deeply
and the kneeling figures prostrate themselves before
him. From a column furthest away from the spectacle
BILL watches as RED CLOAK bangs his staff on the red
carpet, a command that returns the figures to their
kneeling positions. Then he moves slowly around the
circle swinging the incense burner before moving back
to the centre and banging the staff again which causes
the figures to rise to their feet.

RED CLOAK bangs the staff on the carpet a further
time: the figures unclasp the hooks of their cloaks and
let them fall off their shoulders to the floor. The figures
are now revealed to be beautiful young women, naked
except for their masks and G-strings.

As RED CLOAK turns on the spot one of the women
leans to her right to lightly embrace the woman next to
her. She places a kiss on her lips. The kissed woman now
leans to her right and repeats the act 'With the next
woman, the kiss now being ''passed" around the circle.

While BILL tries to fathom what is happening two
figures on a balcony opposite seem to be taking a more
than passing interest in him. They continue staring at
BILL until he slowly becomes aware of them. One of the
figures wears a tricom mask while the other hides behind an androgynous mask. There is a sinister air to
both of them. The man in the tricom mask bows to BILL,
seemingly in recognition. BILL, uncertain at first, returns the bow. Then his attention is drawn back to the
women in the circle.

RED CLOAK, with a rap of his staff on the floor, commands a woman to her feet. The woman bows to RED
CLOAK who then bestows a "blessing" upon her. She
then leaves the circle and approaches a man in the surrounding crowd. She leans forward to "kiss" the man,
their masked lips touching, before leading him off out of
the hall.

BILL watches as the procedure is repeated with the
"blessed" women apparently choosing men at random
from the spectators.

RED CLOAK has now reached a woman in the circle
who wears a mask more alluring than the others, a
beautiful design with black feathered plumes arising
above her head (this is MYSTERIOUS WOMAN). After receiving the "blessing" the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN turns
and walks straight to BILL.

She gently places her hand on his shoulder as she
leans forward to "kiss" him. Then she leads BILL by the
hand out of the hall.

80. INT. RED CARPETED CORRIDOR "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

The MYSTERIOUS WOMAN leads BILL down a red carpeted corridor which, like the hall, has walls of carved
marble. On these walls are large mirrors which reflect
the procession of almost-naked women leading the
masked men away.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
(unexpectedly)
I'm not sure what you think you're doing, but
you don't belong here.

BILL
I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me for
someone else.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Please don't be foolish. You must go now.

BILL
Who are you?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
It doesn't matter who I am. You're in great
danger. And you must get away while there is
still a chance.

An OMINOUS MAN in a large, almost over-sized mask,
suddenly appears and takes the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN's hand.

OMINOUS MAN
(to Bill)
Would you be so good as to excuse us for a
moment?
The OMINOUS MAN leads the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
away up a marble staircase. She looks back at BILL who
is left wondering what is going on in the house.

81. INT. BALCONIED HALLWAY - "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

BILL follows a couple into a large hall that also has
walls of carved marble. There are many doors and archways leading off.

A beautiful naked young woman is astride a man on
his back. They are fucking and oblivious to the spectators crowded all around them.
At the end of the room a naked man eases a woman
in an elegant dress on to a polished table. He begins
fucking her, unaware of BILL who passes closely by.

82. INT. LONG TABLE ROOM - "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

BILL enters the room. On a long table two naked women
in a "sixty-nine" position simulate mutual cunnilingus.

Three other women sit on stools upon the table slowly
and sensuously caressing each other's bodies. Gathered
around the table are masked voyeurs enjoying the spectacle.
BILL continues through the house.

83. INT. ANTE-ROOM/LIBRARY - "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

BILL enters the ante-room. The focus of the crowd's attention is a naked woman, her hands held down by a
masked woman in a red dress, who is being fucked from
behind by a naked man.

BILL walks through and into a sumptuous library
with oak paneled walls and bookcases full of leather
bound volumes.

A roaring fire illuminates the bizarre scene of a
masked man in formal evening dress on his hands and
knees while on his back is a naked woman being fucked
by another man in a Pan-like mask.

BILL joins the other onlookers. Then the man in the
tricom mask enters the room accompanied by a naked
YOUNG WOMAN. They stop and upon a signal from the
man the YOUNG WOMAN walks up to BILL and stands
next to him.

YOUNG WOMAN
Have you been enjoying yourself?

BILL
I've had a very interesting look around.

YOUNG WOMAN
Do you want to go somewhere a little more
private?

BILL
Private? That might be a good idea.

Suddenly, the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN in the beautiful
feathered mask walks up to BILL and interrupts the conversation.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Oh, there you are! I've been looking all over for
you. Where did you go?
(to Girl)
May I borrow him for just a few minutes? I
promise to bring him right back.

The MYSTERIOUS WOMAN takes BILL by the hand and
leads him out of the library.

84. INT. SMALL HALL - "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

The MYSTERIOUS WOMAN looks around her to make
sure no one is about and then takes BILL across the hall.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
I don't think you realize the danger you're in
now. You can't fool them for much longer.
You've got to get away before it's too late.

BILL
Why are you telling me this?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
It doesn't matter.

BILL
Who are you?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
You don't want to know, but you must go now.

BILL
Will you come with me?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
That's impossible.

BILL
Why?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Because it would cost me my life and possibly
yours.

BILL
Let me see your face.

BILL attempts to remove her mask but she holds tight.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
No!

She finally pushes his hands away and then leaves
quickly.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Go!

BILL looks towards her but before he can do anything a
TALL BUTLER arrives. He too is masked.

TALL BUTLER
Excuse me, sir. Are you the gentleman with the
taxi waiting for you?

BILL
Yes.

TALL BUTLER
Your driver's at the front door and would
urgently like a word with you.

He gestures BILL to follow him and they leave the room.

85. INT. LARGE PALM-LINED HALL "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

Couples dance, some naked, some in evening dress, as
NICK Nightingale, still blindfolded, is led through the
room and away down a corridor.

86. INT. RED CARPETED CORRIDOR "SOMERTON" - NIGHT

The TALL BUTLER escorts BILL down the same corridor
along which the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN had earlier led
BILL. As they reach the door of the white marble hall
where BILL had witnessed the opening ritual, they stop.
There, in the middle of the red carpet, sits RED CLOAK
on a throne with acolytes in purple robes standing either side of him. They are surrounded by a circle of
many people in black cloaks and masks.
RED CLOAK beckons BILL to him.

RED CLOAK
Please come forward.

As BILL enters the gap in the circle, the men in black
cloaks close rank, cutting off any way of escape.

RED CLOAK
May I have the password, please?

BILL
Fidelio.

RED CLOAK
That's right, sir. That is the password for
admittance ... but may I ask what is the
password for the house?

BILL
The password for the house?

RED CLOAK
Yes.

BILL
I'm sorry I ... I ... I seem to have forgotten it.

RED CLOAK
That's unfortunate, because here it doesn't
matter whether you have forgotten it or if you
never knew it. You will kindly remove your
mask.
(pause)
Now get undressed.

BILL
Get undressed?

RED CLOAK
Remove your clothes.

BILL
Gentlemen, please ....

RED CLOAK
Remove your clothes, or would you like us to
do it for you?
Suddenly, there is a shout from the balcony behind BILL.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Stop! Let him go. Take me, I am ready to redeem
him.

There is a gasp of surprise from the crowd. RED CLOAK
gets to his feet.

RED CLOAK
You are ready to redeem him?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Yes.

Another gasp of surprise from the crowd.

RED CLOAK
Are you sure you understand what you are
taking upon yourself in doing this?

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Yes.

RED CLOAK
(severely to Bill)
Very well. You are free, but I warn you if you
make any further inquires or if you say a single
word to anyone about what you have seen,
there will be the most dire consequences for
you and your family. Do you understand?

BILL slowly nods his understanding and looks up to the
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN on the balcony. The BIRD MASK
MAN then takes her away.

BILL
What .. . what is going to happen to that
woman?

RED CLOAK
No one can change her fate now. When a
promise has been made here, there is no turning
back. Go!

87. INT. BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The front door of the apartment opens and BILL comes
in carrying a bag with his costume. He quietly shuts and
locks the front door. He walks down the hallway and
looks in at HELENA's room. She lies fast asleep. BILL
turns away and walks on down through the living room,
taking off his coat as he does, and into his study. He
unlocks a cupboard and hides the bag with his costume
there.

88. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL walks into the bedroom to find ALICE asleep but
munnuring in a dream. He sits on the side of the bed,
and ALICE's noises tum to laughing. As the laugh becomes almost hysterical BILL gently touches her. She
awakes with a "start" and is a little distressed.

BILL
Alice ... Alice ... OK. It's OK. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry I woke you up but I thought you were
having a nightmare.

BILL starts to take off his shoes as ALICE tries to calm
down.

ALICE
Oh, God ... I just had such a horrible dream.
What time is it?

BILL
Er, a little after four.

ALICE
Did you just get home?

BILL
Yes, it took longer ... longer than I thought.

ALICE
You must be exhausted. Come on, lie down, lie
down.

ALICE, still slightly upset, reaches out to him and pulls
BILL down next to her.

BILL
What were you dreaming?

ALICE
It's just a ... just these weird things.

BILL
What was it?

ALICE
Oh . . . so weird.

BILL
Tell me.

ALICE sits up, trying to recapture her dream.

ALICE
We ... we were ... we were in a deserted city
and ... and our clothes were gone. We were
naked, and ... and I was terrified, and I ... I
felt ashamed. Oh, God! And ... and I was angry
because I felt it was your fa ult. You ... you
rushed away to try and find our clothes for us.
As soon as you were gone it was completely
clifferent. I ... I felt wonderful. Then I was
lying in a .. . in a beautiful garden, stretched
out naked in the sunlight, and a man walked
out of the woods, he was ... he was the man
from the hotel, the one I told you about ... the
naval officer. He ... he stared at me and then
he just laughed ... he just laughed at me.

ALICE lies down again, burying her face in her pillow.

BILL sits up and looks at her crying into the pillow.

BILL
That's not the end, is it?

ALICE
No.

BILL
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

ALICE
It's ... it's too awful.

BILL
It's only a dream.

ALICE gets close to BILL and envelopes him in her arms
while summoning the courage to continue the story.

ALICE
He ... he was kissing me, and then ... then we
were making love. Then there were all these
other people around us ... hundreds of them,
everywhere. Everyone was fucking, and then I
... I was fucking other men, so many ... I don't
know how many I was with. And I knew you
could see me in the arms of all these men, just
fucking all these men, and I ... I wanted to
make fun of you, to laugh in your face. And so I
laughed as loud as I could. And that must have
been when you woke me up.

She weeps and caresses BILL who is perplexed and sits
not knowing what to feel about what she has told him.

89. EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING

The following morning. A street full of traffic. Crowds.

90. EXT. CAFE SONATA - DAY

A taxi pulls up and BILL gets out. He is carrying the bag
with his costume from the night before. He walks up to
the Cafe Sonata and sees the entrance grill closed and
locked.

BILL
Shit....

He wonders what to do. He looks around and sees that
Gillespie's Coffee Shop next door is open. He goes inside.

91. INT. GILLESPIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

BILL walks in and finds a seat at the counter. An attractive WAITRESS behind the counter greets him.

WAITRESS
Hi!

BILL
Hi. I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.
She pours BILL a cup.

WAITRESS
Anything else?

BILL
No, thank you.

The WAITRESS writes a check and lays it in front of him.

BILL
Excuse me, would you happen to know when
they get in next door at the Sonata Cafe?

WAITRESS
I think there's usually someone in the office
round two or three.

BILL
Round two or three. Umm . . . I, erh . . . I don't
suppose, by any chance, you know Nick
Nightingale? He's playing piano over there right
now?

WAITRESS
Nick Nightingale? Sure, he comes in here.

BILL
Look ... look maybe you can help me, because.
it's very important that I get in touch with him
this morning.. Do you know where he's staying?

WAITRESS
Well ... I, I don't know whether he would want
me to give out his address.

BILL
It's OK, I'm a doctor. I'm . .. I'm actually a very
old friend of his.

BILL shows her his State Medical Board card.

WAITRESS
Well, doctor, umm . . . he'll be playing there
tonight. Can it wait until then?

BILL
Listen, to be perfectly honest, erh ... it's a
medical matter, some tests. And I know he'll
wanna know about them as soon as possible.

92. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

The morning traffic is in full flow. The streets crowded
with pedestrians. BILL, carrying his bag, walks up the
street and comes to the Hotel Jason. He goes in.

93. INT. LOBBY - HOTEL JASON - DAY

It's a clean, respectable, moderately priced establishment; BILL walks up to the reception desk and calls to
the gay CLERK who is putting a letter in a guest's
pigeon-hole.

BILL
Excuse me.

CLERK
Hi! How can I help you?

BILL
Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale's room for
me? Nick Nightingale.

CLERK
I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Nightingale has already
checked out.

BILL
He checked out?

CLERK
Yes.

BILL
Er .. . did he leave a forwarding address?

CLERK
No, I'm afraid not, no.

BILL
When did he check out?

CLERK
Umm ... about five o'clock this morning.

BILL
Five o'clock this morning?

CLERK
Yes.

BILL
It's a pretty early check out, isn't it?

CLERK
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

BILL
Look ... did you notice anything, I dunno,
unusual about him when he left?

CLERK
Unusual? Hey! You're not Five O , are you?

BILL
No, I'm an old friend of his.

CLERK
Really?

BILL
I'm a doctor.

CLERK
Oh.

BILL shows him his State Medical Board Card. The
CLERK starts getting very friendly.

CLERK
Well, umm ... Bill?

BILL
Sure.

CLERK
It's funny you should ask that question, Bill,
because actually there was something a little
strange about the way Mr. Nightingale left, yes.

BILL
Really, what? What was that?

CLERK
Well ... he came in this morning about fourthirty a.m. with two men. Big guys. I mean,
they were very well dressed and very well
spoken but they weren't the kind of people
you'd like to fool around with . . . if you know
what I mean. Anyway, I noticed Mr.
Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek and umm
... to be perlectly honest, I also thought he
looked a little scared.

BILL
Scared?

CLERK
Yes, yes. He . . . he said he wanted to check out
and then he went upstairs to his room with one
of the men and the other guy stayed down in
the lobby and settled his bill. And then, when
they came back down, Mr. Nightingale tried to
pass me an envelope but they saw it and and
took it away and said that any mail or messages
for him would be collected by someone properly
authorized to do so. And then they just took him
off in a car.

BILL
Do you have any idea where they went?

CLERK
No, not a clue.

BILL
Um . .. well, anyway . . . I certainly .. . I
certainly appreciate your help.

CLERK
Oh! Anytime, Bill. Bye!

BILL leaves the Hotel Jason.

94. EXT. STREET- GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

A taxi pulls up outside RAINBOW FASHIONS where BILL
had hired the costume the night before. BILL gets out the
cab with his bag and ascends the stoop.

95. INT. RAINBOW FASHIONS - DAY

BILL walks to the counter and puts the bag on it.

MILICH
Oh, the good doctor.

BILL
Mr Milich.

MILICH
Was your outfit the success?

BILL
Yes, it was. Thank you.

MILICH starts to take the costume out of the bag.

MILICH
Good, good.
(pause)
Tuxedo, cloak, shoes, erh... . I think you forgot
the mask.

BILL
It's not there?

BILL, troubled, picks through the clothes on the counter.

MILICH
No, no, no. Maybe you left it at the party?

BILL
Er ... I don't think so. I must have lost it, Can
you just put it on the bill, please?

MILICH
Sure.

MILICH opens the till and takes out the receipt from the
night before.

MILICH
Here we are. That was one hundred fifty for the
rental, two hundred you said for my trouble,
twenty five for the mask - sorry. That's ...
three hundred and seventy-five.

Then the door at the end of the shop opens and the
DAUGHTER appears who BILL saw with the JAPANESE
MEN. She has only her bra and panties on with a flimsy
kimono.

MILICH
(to Daughter)
Yes, dear ... come, come.

The DAUGHTER walks to the counter and stands next to
MILICH.

MILICH
Would you like to say hello to Dr Harford?

DAUGHTER
(to Bill)
Hello!

She offers her hand to BILL and they shake.

BILL
Hello.

Then the JAPANESE MEN appear through the door, both
smartly dressed. They hesitate on seeing BILL and then
they slowly walk up to MILICH and his DAUGHTER.

JAPANESE MAN 1
Thank you, Mr Milich. I'll call you soon.
Bye-bye.

They take their leave, one of them blowing a kiss to the
DAUGHTER.

MILICH
Goodbye, gentlemen. Merry Christmas and
happy new year!
(pause)
Well, Dr Harlord, there is your receipt. I'm
tearing up your deposits, and thanks for the
business.

While MILICH does this BILL looks at the DAUGHTER
who returns a knowing look. BILL is shocked by what he
has seen.

BILL
Mr Milich, last night . . . you were going to call
the police.

MILICH
Well . .. things change. We have come to
another arrangement. And, by the way, if the
good doctor himself should ever want anything
again - anything at all. . . .

MILICH puts his arm around his DAUGHTER's shoul ders. BILL sees the fragile, china doll-like face of the girl.

MILICH
(suggestively)
It needn't be a costume ...

BILL is left speechless at this invitation.

96. EXT. AVENUE - NEW YORK - DAY

A busy avenue with office blocks in mid-town Manhattan.

97. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - DAY

BILL, in his white doctor's coat, sits deep in thought.

98. INT. ROOM - CAPE COD - DAY

BILL continues to brood over the fantasy ofALICE making love with the NAVAL OFFICER.

99. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - DAY

BILL, still wrapped up in his thoughts, is interrupted by
a knock at the door.

BILL
Come in.

LISA comes in with a "take-away" food bag and coffee.

LISA
Tuna salad and black coffee.

BILL
Thanks. Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

LISA
I think it's just Mrs Akerly at two-thirty and
Mrs Kominski at four.

BILL
Well, look, something' s come up and I'm not
going to be able to see them. Please ask Dr
Miller if he can fit them in, otherwise just
apologize and make new appointments.

LISA
Sure.

BILL
And please, call the garage and have them get

100. EXT. RANGE ROVER - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

BILL's Range Rover speeds over the bridge.

101. INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

BILL continues driving over the bridge.

102. EXT. RANGE ROVER - FREEWAY - DAY

BILL's Range Rover on its way through the suburbs.

103. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

BILL's Range Rover slows down on a road lined with fir
trees. It turns into the gateway of "Somerton" the house
where the masked ball had been held the night before,
and comes to a halt to the fore of the gates. Nobody is
about.

BILL gets out of the Range Rover and slowly walks
to the closed gates. He looks up and sees a surveillance
camera tracking him. He is wondering what to do when
he sees a limousine coming down the driveway towards
him. It comes to a stop the other side of the gates.

An ELDERLY MAN, smartly dressed, gets out of the car
and walks up to the gates while keeping a steady eye on
BILL. He takes a letter from his inside pocket and pushes
it through the gate.

BILL approaches the ELDERLY MAN and takes the letter. Without saying a word, the man tums, goes back to
the car and is driven away.

BILL looks at the envelope and sees "DR. WILLIAM
HARFORD" typed on it. He opens it and takes out a
sheet of paper. Written on it is a warning to him:
Give up your inquiries which are completely
useless, and consider these words a second
wanting. We hope, for your own good, that
this will be sufficient.

BILL thinks long and hard about this warning and
what it implies. He turns away from the gates to go back
to his car.

104. EXT. BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Night time traffic. Illuminations. People walking about.

105. INT. BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL comes in through the front door and closes it. He is
wearing an overcoat and canying a case. He walks
down the corridor.

ALICE (o/s)
Hi.

HELENA (o/s)
Hi, daddy!

BILL
(Walking)
Hi! Any calls for me?

BILL takes his coat off and drops it over a chair in the
hallway. He continues into the dining room where he
sees ALICE sitting with HELENA doing some homework.

ALICE seems pleased to see him. BILL kisses ALICE on
the head. and strokes HELENA's hair.

ALICE (o/s)
Dr Sanders and, erh ... Mrs Shapiro.

HELENA
Hi, daddy!

BILL
Hey . ...

HELENA proudly shows him her schoolbook.

HELENA
Look, I got all these right.

BILL
You got all those right?

HELENA
Yeah.

BILL
Every single one of them?

HELENA
Ah-hah ....

BILL
That's good

ALlCE
You hungry?

BILL
Er ... sort of.

ALICE
Want to eat at seven?

BILL
Ooh! Seven. Listen, can we make that a little
earlier because I have some appointments at
the office?

ALICE
You have to go out again, tonight?

BILL
Mmm, afraid so.

HELENA
Daddy, am I gonna get a puppy for Christmas?

BILL
(kissing Helena)
Well, we'll ... we'll see about that OK?

BILL walks into the kitchen, opens the fridge and takes
out a drink.

HELENA
He could be a watchdog?

BILL
We'll see.

ALICE
Come on, baby, let's finish this off. All right, we
have Joe and Joe has two dollars fifty, Mike has
one dollar and seventy-five cents. Joe has bow
much more money than Mike?

HELENA
One hundred and seventy-five.

ALICE
So, is it going to be a subtraction or addition?

HELENA
Hmmm . .. how much more means,that it
would be an subtraction, wouldn't it?

ALICE
Yeah, so you are going to be taking, right ...

As ALICE helps HELENA with her homework BILL
watches from the kitchen ALICE's words from the
night before come back to haunt him:

ALICE (v/o)
And there were all these other people.
Hundreds of them everywhere, and everyone
was fucking. And then I ... I was fucking other
men, so many, I ... I don't know bow many I
was with.

While BILL can hear her voice in his head ALICE gives
him a look full of love and affection. BILL responds with
a forced smile.

106. INT. RECEPTION AREA - BILL'S SURGERY - NIGHT

The Christmas lights illuminate the area. At the end of
the reception we see a door ajar and light coming
through it.

107. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - NIGHT

BILL sits staring at the telephone.

108. INT. ROOM - CAPE COD - DAY

The thought of ALICE making love with the NAVAL OFFICER invades BILL's mind again.

109. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - NIGHT

BILL, still staring at his phone, decides to act. He picks
up the receiver and punches in a number.

110. INT. HALLWAY - NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

The phone rings in the hallway. CARL walks down the
corridor and picks up the receiver.

CARL
Hello? Hello? Hello?

111. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - NIGHT

BILL is disappointed at heanng CARL's voice. He had
been expecting MARION to answer.

112. INT. HALLWAY-NATHANSON APARTMENT - NIGHT

CARL is still trying to get a response from the telephone.

113. INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BILL'S SURGERY - NIGHT

BILL thinks for a moment, then puts the p"hone down.
He is clearly troubled.

114. EXT. DOMINO APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A taxi pulls up at the curbside outside DOMINO's apartment building in Greenwich Village. BILL gets out and
pays his fare.

BILL
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

BILL is carrying a small cake-box. The cab drives off as
BILL walks up the stoop to the front door. He stands
aside to let a parcel-laden lady go by, then goes irz.
through the front door.

115. INT. LOBBY - DOMINO APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A shabby lobby. BILL walks up to the apartment door.
He rings the bell. A woman's voice is heard from the
other side of the door. This is SALLY.

SALLY (o/s)
Who is it?

BILL
Domino?

SALLY (o/s)
No, she's not in.

BILL
Er .. . are you expecting her back soon?

SALLY (o/s)
No, I'm not.

BILL
OK. I have something for her. Can I leave this
with you?

SALLY (o/s)
Just a minute ....

The door is unlocked and SALLY's face appears. BILL
gives her the cake boxr

SALLY
(talking box)
Can I say who it's from?

BILL
Well, just tell her it's from Bill.

SALLY
You're Bill . .. the Bill? You're the doctor who
was here last night?

BILL
Well, I suppose I am.

SALLY
Domino said how nice you were to her.

BILL
Did she?

SALLY
Uh-huh. Why don't you come in for a second?

BILL
Sure.

BILL enters the apartment.

116. INT. DOMINO APARTMENT - NIGHT

SALLY closes and locks the door. She is very attractive,
about DOMINO's age, and she signals to BILL to go into
the kitchen. As he enters he stops and turns.

SALLY, who likes the look of him, puts the cake on the
table and blatantly pushes herself up against him.

SALLY
I'm Sally.

BILL
Hello, Sally.

BILL, taking offhis overcoat, is not reticent in returning
the advance.

SALLY
Hi.

BILL
So, do you have any idea when you expect
Domino back?

SALLY
No, I have no idea.

BILL
You have no idea?
They are flirting heavily now.

SALLY
No. Well, to be perfectly honest, she ... she may
not even be coming back.

BILL
(laughs)
She may not even be coming back?

Excited by their closeness, BILL starts to fondle SALLY's
breast.

SALLY
Well, umm , .. I, erh ....

BILL
You, erh....

SALLY
(awkwardly)
I think some ... something that I should tell
you.

BILL
Really?

SALLY
Yeah ... but I don't know.

BILL
You don't know? What is it?

SALLY is very taken by the advance from BILL, but
forces herself to talk.

SALLY
I don't know whether to tell you this. Oh, well
... why don't you ... why don't you have a
seat?
(pause)
OK, let's sit down.

They separate and sit at each end of the kitchen table.
BILL laughs at SALLY's difficulty in saying what is on
her mind.

SALLY
Oh .. . I don't quite know how to say this.

BILL
You don't quite know how?

SALLY
Well, considering that you were with Domino
last night ...

BILL
Hmm....

SALLY
(very awkwardly)
I think it would be only fair to you, to let you
know that, umm .. . she got the results of a
blood test this morning and, erh ... it was HIV
positive.

BILL is taken aback. He was not expecting news like
this.

BILL
HIV positive?

SALLY
Yeah.

BILL doesn't know what to say.

BILL
Well, I am very ... very sorry to hear that.

SALLY
Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

Both of them sit there, lost for something to say. SALLY
tries to snap out of it.

SALLY
(breezily)
Listen, can I offer you anything? Cup of coffee
maybe?

BILL
No thank you. I think erh . .. maybe I had better
be going.

117. EXT. STREET - SOHO - NIGHT

It is deserted, but for a passing car, as we see BILL
slowly walking down the street.

118. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SOHO - NIGHT

BILL, hands thrust deep in his pockets, becomes aware
ofsomebody else walking behind him. He looks back and
sees a figure keeping a distance on the opposite side of
the street. BILL realizes he is being followed. This is the
STALKER.

119. EXT. ANOTHER STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

BILL turns a comer and checks behind him. He continues down the street and looks back.

The STALKER, though keeping his distance, has now
crossed to BILL's side of the stree·t. He's a heavy set guy
with a shaved head.

BILL, now worried, tries to hail a cab, but none stpp.
Then he sees a ta.xi. pull up and someone gets out. BILL
runs across to grab the cab and starts to open the door.

BILL
Taxi.

DRIVER
Off duty.

The cab pulls away, leaving BILL at the curbside.

BILL tries to see if the STALKER is still following him
and then decia,es to continue walking. As he reaches a
newspaper kiosk he sees the STALKER come round the
comer and stop. BILL stops too and looks at him for
some time while wondering what will happen next.

BILL then picks up a copy of the New York Post and
throws some change down. The STALKER crosses the
street, all the time keeping a steady watch on BILL. Then
he stops and BILL waits. Finally, after a stand-off, the
STALKER walks away leaving BILL feeling very anxious.

BILL turns and walks down the street. He sees Sharkey's Cafe and welcomes the security the company of
other people will afford him.

120. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SHARKEY'S CAFE - NIGHT

BILL walks up the stairs and into the cafe.

121. INT. SHARKEY'S CAFE - NIGHT

BILL enters. Mozart's Requiem is playing and the place
is full of people. He goes to the counter and a friendly
waitress looks up.

BILL
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

WAITRESS
I'll bring it over to you.

BILL sees a table at the other end of the room and goes
across to it. He sits down and opens the New York Post
and glances agitatedly out of the cafe windows.
Suddenly, something in the paper catches his eye: a
headline which reads, EX-BEAUTY QUEEN IN HOTEL
DRUGS OVERDOSE. He reads the article in dread of
what it seems to be revealing.

122. EXT. HOSPITAL - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A busy Manhattan general hospital: ambulances, cars,
staff and public.

123. INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Through the revolving glass doors, we see a cab pull up
outside. BILL gets out and walks through the revolving
door and up to the reception desk.

BILL
Good evening.

RECEPTIONIST
Good evening.

BILL
I'm Dr Harford. One of my patients was
admitted earlier this morning, a Miss Amanda
Curran. Could you please give me her room
number?

RECEPTIONIST
(keyboarding a computer terminal)
Certainly. Her name again?

BILL
Curran. Amanda Curran.

The RECEPTIONIST checks the spelling as she enters the
name on the computer.

RECEPTIONIST
C . . . U . . . R . . . R . . . A . . . N?

BILL
Yes.

RECEPTIONIST
Miss Amanda Curran?

BILL
That's right.

RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry, doctor, Miss Curran died this
afternoon.

BILL
She died this afternoon?

RECEPTIONIST
Yes, at three-forty-five p.m. I'm sorry.

124. INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

BILL follows an ORDERLY down the corridor.

125. INT. MORGUE - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The ORDERLY leads BILL into the morgue and then
walks over to a bank of refrigerated body drawers and
pulls out a body on a tray. He steps back.

BILL stands looking at the corpse - we recognize her
as the woman we saw at ZIEGLER's party, the one who
had over-dosed in the bathroom, MANDY.

BILL leans closer to study her face. He moves around
to her head. He leans forward, bringing his face close to
hers, and closes his eyes. It's as if he were going to kiss
her. He stops short and slowly pulls back until he is looking down at her face.

126. INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Despondently, BILL walks down the corridor. His mobile phone rings. He takes it out of his pocket.

BILL
Hello? Yes, it's Dr Harford ... Tonight? ... No,
no, no. That's OK. Just, please, tell him that. I'll
be there in about twenty minutes ... OK?

127. EXT. ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

Lights burning in most rooms. Night traffic.

128. INT. CORRIDOR/HALL - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

HARRIS, ZIEGLER's personal assistant, leads BILL
down the corridor and across the hall. Not a word is
spoken. They come to a door and HARRIS knocks on it.

129. INT. BILLIARD ROOM - ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT

A big, pine paneled room, lined with books and antique
artifacts. In the middle of the room ZIEGLER is alone,
playing shots on the billiard table. ZIEGLER hears the
knock, puts the cue down and walks across the room to
the door.

ZIEGLER
(calling out)
Come in.

HARRIS opens the door, lets BILL in and closes the door
immediately after.

ZIEGLER
Bill, I appreciate you coming.

BILL
Sure.

ZIEGLER
Sorry to drag you over tonight. Let me have
your coat.

BILL
(removing over-coat)
No, no. I ... I was out anyway, thank you.

ZIEGLER
How about a drink?

ZIEGLER gives BILL a friendly slap on the shoulder as
he takes his coat.

BILL
Are you having one?

ZIEGLER
Sure.

They walk over to the drinks table. ZIEGLER laying
BILL's coat over an annchair.

BILL
OK.

ZIEGLER
What would you like?

BILL
Just a little scotch.

ZIEGLER
Good. How do you take it? Neat?

ZIEGLER pours the drinks.

BILL
Please. That was a terrific party the other night.
Alice and I had a wonderful time.

ZIEGLER
Well, good, good. It was great seeing you both.
Cheers.

They "clink" glasses and ZIEGLER leads BILL over to
the billiard table.

BILL
Cheers. Were you playing?

ZIEGLER
No. Just knocking a few balls around.

They face each other across the table as BILL takes a
drink.

BILL
Beautiful scotch.

ZIEGLER
That's a twenty-five-year-old. I'll send you over
a case.

BILL
No, please.

ZIEGLER
Sure, why not?

BILL
No ... no!

ZIBGLER
You, erh ... do you feel like playing?

ZIEGLER starts playing with a billiard ball. He looks
particularly ill at ease.

BILL
No thanks .. . you go ahead. I'll watch.

ZIEGLER
No, no, no, no, no, no. I ... I was just, erh ....
Listen, Bill, the reason I asked you to come
over, I, I ... I need to talk to you about
something.

BILL
Sure.

ZIEGLER
It's a little bit awkward. And I have to be
completely frank.

BILL
What kind of problem are you having?

ZIEGLER
It isn't a medical problem.

ZIEGLER slowly walks around the tabl.e towards BILL.

ZIEGLER
Actually, it concerns you, Bill ... I . .. I know
what happened last night. And I know what's
been going on since then. And I think youjust
might . . . have the wrong idea about one or two
things.

BILL
I'm sorry, Victor, I . . . what in the hell are you
talking about?

ZIEGLER
Please, Bill, no games. I was there, at the house.
I saw everything that went on. Bill, what the
hell did you think you were doing?

ZIEGLER picks up his glass and starts to pace the floor.

ZIEGLER
I couldn't, I couldn't even begin to, to imagine
how, how you had even heard about it, let alone
got yourself through the door. And then I
remembered seeing you with that ... that ...
that prick piano player .. . Nick whatever-thefuck his name was at my party. It didn't take
much to figure out the rest.

BILL stares at the table in embarrassment.

BILL
It wasn't Nick's fault. It was mine.

ZIEGLER
(still pacing)
Of course it was Nick's fault. If he hadn't
m·e ntioned it to you in the first place, none of
this would have happened. I recommended that
little cocksucker to those people and he's made
me look like a complete asshole.

BILL
Victor, what can I say? I had . . . absolutely no
idea you were involved in any way.

ZIEGLER leans on the table trying to gain composure.

ZIEGLER
I know you didn't, Bill. But I also know that you
... you went to Nick's hotel this morning and
talked to the desk clerk.

BILL
How do you know that?

ZIEGLER
Because I had you followed.

BILL "snorts" a short laugh in response.

BILL
You had me followed?

Now it is ZIEGLER's turn to be embarrassed.

ZIEGLER
I ... OK, OK! I'm sorry all right. I owe you an
apology, I . .. this was for your own good,
believe me. Now look, I know what the desk
clerk told you but what he didn't tell you is that
all they did was put Nick on a plane to Seattle.
By now he's probably back with his family ...
probably banging Mrs Nick.

ZIEGLER's attempt to lighten the conversation falls flat
with BILL.

BILL
The clerk said he had a bruise on his face.

ZIEGLER moves closer to BILL and sits on the table.

ZIEGLER
OK, he had a bruise on his face. That's a hell of
a lot less than he deserves. Listen, Bill. I don't
think you realize what sort of trouble you were
in last night.

ZIEGLER gets off the table, picks up BILL's glass and
walks to the drinks table.

ZIEGLER
What do you think those people were? They
weren't just ordinary people there. If I told you
their names ... I'm not gonna tell you their
names, but if I did, I don't think you'd sleep so
well.

BILL
Was it the second password? Is that what gave
me away?

ZIEGLER pours more scotch for BILL and himself and
puts BILL's glass on the billiard table. ZIEGLER then
walks over to an armchair on the other side of the room.

ZIEGLER
Yes, finally. But not because you didn't know it
... it's because there was no second password.

ZIEGLER sits down in the armchair.

ZIEGLER
Of course, it didn't help a whole lot ... those
people arrive in limos and you showed up in a
taxi. Or, that when they took your coat, they
found the receipt from the rental house in your
pocket, made out to you-know-who ....

BILL moves away and turns his back on ZIEGLER. He
feels very awkward.

BILL
There was a ... there was a ... there was a
woman there, who, erh ... tried to warn me.

ZIBGLER
I know....

BILL
Do you know who she was?

ZIEGLER gets up and goes near to where BILL stands
with his back still turned. He puts his glass on the edge
of the table.

ZIEGLER
Yes ... she was ... she was a hooker. Sorry, but
that's what she was.

BILL moves away, still with his back to ZIEGLER and
sits in an armchair. He runs his hand through his hair,
trying to figure everything out.

BILL
A hooker?

ZIEGLER
Bill, suppose I told you that .. . that everything
that happened to you there, the threats, the
girls . .. warnings, the last minute
interventions . .. suppose I said all of that was
staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it
was fake?

BILL
Fake?

ZIEGLER
Yes, fake.

BILL
(not understanding)
Why would they do that?

ZIEGLER
Why? In plain words, to scare the living shit out
of you. To keep you quiet about where you'd
been and what you'd seen.

BILL takes the article he tore out of the New York Post
in Sharkey's Cafe and hands it to ZIEGLER who looks at
it.

BILL
Have you seen this?

ZIEGLER
Yes, I have.
He folds it and gives it back to BILL.

BILL
I saw her body, in the morgue. Was she ... was
she the woman at the party?

ZIEGLER, hands in pockets, moves away to the billiard
table.

ZIEGLER
Yes, she was.

BILL, in an attempt to put everything together, gets up
and walks away from ZIEGLER as if to put some distance between them.

BILL
Victor, the woman lying dead in the morgue
was the woman at the party?

ZIEGLER
Yes.

BILL, getting very upset, turns round on ZIEGLER.

BILL
Well, Victor, maybe I'm . .. missing something
here. You called it a fake, charade. Do you mind
telling me what kind of fucking charade ends
with somebody turning up dead?

ZIEGLER
(rising anger)
OK, Bill. Let's ... let's ... let's . . . let's cut the
bullshit, all right? You've been way out of your
depth for the last twenty-four hours. You
wanna know what kinda charade? I'll tell you
exactly what kind. That whole play-acted "take
me" phony sacrifice that you've been jerking
yourself off with had absolutely nothing to do
w ith her real death. Nothing happened to her
after you left that party that hadn't happened
to her before. She got her brains fucked out.
Period.
(pause)
When they took her home she was just fine and
the rest of it's right there in the paper. She was
a junky. She OD'd. There was nothing
suspicious. Her door was locked from the
inside. The police are happy. End of story.
(pause)
Come on ... it was always just gonna be a
matter of time with her. Remember, you told
her so yourself? Remember the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

BILL hangs his head as he recollects that it was indeed
what he'd told ZIEGLER and MANDY at the party after
the "bathroom incident."

BILL slowly moves away as ZIEGLER, trying to mollify him, walks up behind him.

ZIEGLER
Listen, Bill. Nobody killed anybody. Someone
died. It happens all the time. Life goes on. It
always does until it doesn't.

ZIEGLER lays his hands on BILL's shoulders in a
friendly reassuring way.

ZIEGLER
But you know that, don't you?

130. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The mask that BILL wore at the ball rests an a pillow
bathed in moonlight. Next to it lies ALICE asleep.

131. INT. HALLWAY - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The front door opens and a totally dejected BILL enters.
He slowly walks down the hallway, takes off his over-
coat and just dumps it on a chair. He walks across the
living room towards the illuminated Christmas tree. He
pauses to look at the tree then switches its lights off.

BILL takes off his jacket and hangs it over the back of
a chair. Tired and exhausted he walks, dejectedly, into
the kitchen, loosening his tie. He goes to the fridge and
takes out a can of beer. Then he goes to the table, slumps
down into a chair and starts to drink.

132. INT. BEDROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL quietly opens the bedroom door. To his dismay, he
sees the mask on the pillow next to ALICE. BILL, emotionally wrecked, walks slowly towards the bed and sits
down with tears in his eyes. Finally, he can restrain
himself no longer, and breaks down into uncontrollable
sobbing.
ALICE wakes to see BILL's complete helplessness as he
collapses and lays his head on her breast. She puts an
ann around him as he sobs.

BILL
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything.

133. INT. LIVING ROOM - BILL & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dawn has given way to early morning. ALICE, cigarette
in hand, sits in tearful silence as she contemplates what
BILL has told her. She looks at BILL who sits on the sofa
opposite looking ashamed, humiliated, remorseful.

ALICE, trying to constrain her disappointment, remembers what they have to do this day.

ALICE
Helena's gonna be up soon. She's uh ... she's
expecting us to take her Christmas shopping
today.

134. INT. TOY STORE - DAY

BILL and ALICE walk together with HELENA who is trying to catch the soap bubbles floating in the air above
her. Then HELENA run's off as BILL and ALICE follow,
BILL glancing anxiously at ALICE as they go. They catch
up with HELENA as she looks at a toy pram.

ALICE
That's nice.

HELENA
I could put Sabrina in here.

ALICE
Yeah.

HELENA
It's really ... pretty.

ALICE
It's old fashioned.

HELENA runs off again and when BILL and ALICE catch
up with her, they see she has discovered a huge teddy
bear.

ALICE
He's big.

HELENA
I hope Santa Claus gets me one of these for
Christmas!

ALICE
You do?

HELENA
Yes.

ALICE
Well, you're gonna have to wait and see.

HELENA runs off again, and BILL and ALICE follow,
each with everything to say but no way of saying it until
BILL plucks up the courage to speak.

BILL
Alice . .. what do you think we should do?

They stop and ALICE tries to gather her thoughts.

ALICE
What do I think we should do?

HELENA
Look, Mommy.

BILL and ALICE look at HELENA who holds up a fairy
doll. They smile at her.

ALICE
Oh ... what do I think? I dunno. I mean,
maybe ...

They move away into an aisle where ALICE stops and
begins to explain her feelings. HELENA walks between
them which brings ALICE to a halt.

ALICE
(to Helena)
Hey!

When she thinks HELENA is out of earshot, ALICE continues, searching for words.

ALICE
Maybe, I think, we should be grateful ...
grateful that we've managed to survive through
all of our adventures, whether they w ere real
or only a dream.

BILL
(moving closer)
Are you ... are you sure of that?

ALICE
Am ... am I sure? Umm ... only ... only as
sure as I am that the reality of one night, let
alone that of a whole life time, can ever be the
whole truth.

BILL
And no dream is ever just a dream.

ALICE
Hmm . .. The important thing is we're awake
now and hopefully for a long time to come.

BILL
Forever.

ALICE
Forever?

BILL
Forever.

ALICE
Let's ... let's not use that word, it frightens me.
But I do love you and you know there is
something very important we need to do as
soon as possible?

BILL
What's that?

ALICE
Fuck.

[FINIS]
