        <p>
          But now that the day's work was done— the child had gone to bed and no disturbance was
          likely—the
          shadowy forms of the masquerade, the melancholy stranger and the red dominoes, rose again
          into
          reality. And all at once those insignificant events were imbued, magically and painfully,
          with the
          deceptive glow of neglected opportunities. Harmless but probing questions, and sly,
          ambiguous answers
          were exchanged. Neither failed to notice that the other was not absolutely honest, and so
          they became
          slightly vindictive. They exaggerated the degree of attraction that their unknown partners
          at the ball had
          exerted upon them while each made fun of the other's tendencies to jealousy and denied his
          own. Soon,
          their light conversation about the trifling matters of the night before changed into a
          more serious
          discussion of those hidden, scarcely suspected wishes, which can produce dangerous
          whirlpools even in
          the serenest and purest soul. They spoke of those mysterious regions of which they were
          hardly
          conscious but toward which the incomprehensible wind of fate might some day drive them,
          even if only
          in their dreams. For though they were united in thought and feeling, they knew that the
          preceding day
          had not been the first time that the spirit of adventure, freedom and danger had beckoned
          them.
          Uneasy, and tormenting themselves, each sought with disingenuous curiosity to draw out
          confessions
          from the other. Anxiously, they searched within themselves for some indifferent fact, or
          trifling
          experience, which might express the inexpressible, and the honest confession of which
          might relieve
          them of the strain and the suspicion which were becoming unbearable.</p>

        <p> Whether <persName ref="#Albertina">Albertina</persName> was more impatient, more honest
          or more kind-hearted of the two, it was she who first summoned the courage for a frank
          confession. She asked <persName ref="#Fridolin">Fridolin</persName> in a rather uncertain
          voice whether he remembered the young man who—last summer at the seashore in <placeName
            ref="#Denmark">Denmark</placeName>—had been sitting one evening with two other officers
          at an adjoining table. He had received a telegram during dinner, whereupon he had hastily
          said "good-bye" to his friends.</p>

        <p>
          <persName ref="Fridolin">Fridolin</persName> nodded. "What about him?" he asked.
