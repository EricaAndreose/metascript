                    <p>That afternoon you and I made love and talked about our future, and our
                        child.</p>
                    <p>Later we were sitting on the balcony and he passed below us without looking
                        up.</p>
                    <p>Just the sight of him stirred me deeply and I thought if he wanted me, I
                        could not have resisted. I thought I was ready to give up you, the child, my
                        whole future.</p>
                    <p>And yet at the same time - if you can understand it - you were dearer to me
                        than ever, and I stroked your forehead and kissed your hair, and at that
                        moment my love for you was both tender and sad.</p>
                    <p>At dinner I wore a white rose and you said I was very beautiful. It might not
                        have been just an accident that he and his friends sat near us.</p>
                    <p>He didn't look up but I actually considered getting up, walking over to him
                        and like someone in a movie, saying, 'Here I am, my love, for whom I have
                        waited - take me.'</p>
                    <p>Well, it was about then that the waiter brought him the envelope. He read it,
                        turned pale, said goodbye to his friends - and glancing at me mysteriously,
                        he left the room.</p>

                    <p>I think it started in my parents house. They weren't there. I was alone. That
                        surprised me because our wedding was the next day and I didn't have a
                        wedding dress.</p>
                    <p>Then you and I were floating above a ancient city. It was a kind of crazy mix
                        of ancient architectural styles. Oriental, Egyptian, Greek and Roman
                        architecture. And it was completely deserted. The streets were empty - no
                        people, no animals. And I remember thinking, so this is our honeymoon.</p>
                    <p>Then it was night and the sky was so full of stars, and so blue and wide it
                        seemed like it was painted. You said it was the ceiling of our bridal
                        chamber and you took me in your arms and made love to me and said you would
                        love me forever.</p>

                    <p>Even more than you did me. We made love and it was wonderful, though there
                        was a sadness to it, and a presentment of sorrow.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly it was morning and we were somewhere in the strange city.</p>
                    <p>We were still completely alone. But something terrible had happened - our
                        clothes were gone. I was terrified as I had never been before, and felt such
                        a burning shame that it almost consumed me.</p>
                    <p>At the same time I was furious with you because I thought it was your fault.
                        And this sensation of terror, shame and fury was more intense than any
                        emotion I had ever felt before.</p>
                    <p>You felt guilty and rushed away naked, to go and get clothes for us.</p>
                    <p>As soon as you were gone I felt wonderful. I neither felt sorry for you, or
                        worried about you. It was heavenly to be alone.</p>
                    <p>I was lying in a lush garden, stretched out naked in the sunlight, and I was
                        far more beautiful than I ever was in reality.</p>
                    <p>And while I lay there, a young man walked out of the woods. He was the young
                        Naval officer I told you about from the hotel.</p>
                    <p>He looked different but I knew it was him. He stopped in front of me and
                        looked at me searchingly.</p>
                    <p>I laughed seductively and wantonly, as I have never laughed in my life, and
                        he held out his arms to me and sank down beside me.</p>

                        increased.</p>
                    <p>And just as that earlier feeling of terror and shame went beyond anything I

                        the..._desire_ that I now felt.</p>
                    <p>Then I realized there other couples around us - hundreds of them, and they

                    <p>I can't say how many I was with. And yet I didn't for one moment forget you.
                        And all this time, you were buying the most beautiful clothes and jewellery
                        you could find for me.</p>
                    <p>Then you were being followed by a crowd of people who were shouting threats.
                        Then you were seized by soldiers, and there were also priests among them.
                        Somebody - a gigantic person, tied your hands. You were still naked.</p>
                    <p>I knew you were going to be crucified but I felt no sympathy for you. I still
                        blamed you for everything that had happened.</p>
                    <p>I felt that I was far removed from you but I knew you could see me naked in
                        the arms of countless men in this sea of nakedness which foamed around me.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers began to whip you and blood flowed down you in streams. I saw it
                        without feeling any surprise or pity.</p>
                    <p>Then you smiled at me as if to show you had fulfilled my wish and bought me
                        everything I wanted. But I thought your actions were ridiculous and I wanted
                        to make fun of you - to laugh in your face.</p>
                    <p>They began to nail you to the cross and I hoped that you would be able to
                        hear my laughter. And so I laughed as shrill and loud as I could... That

                        She got a lot of attention, that was certainly true, but nothing she didn't
                        want. And later, when my people left her at the hotel, they said everything
